<small>A QUEER CUSTOMER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span>! Good news, mother!” cried Tom
Baldwin, as he hurried into the house, throwing
his hat on the rack. “Fine luck! Where are
you?”</p>

<p>“Upstairs, sewing,” replied a woman’s voice.
“My, Tom, but you are making quite a noise.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it, mother! I’ve got good news!
I’ve got a job!”</p>

<p>“Have you really, Tom? Come right up and
tell us about it. I’m very glad!”</p>

<p>“Tell him to be sure and wipe his feet,” added
another woman’s voice, from the same upstairs-room
where Mrs. Baldwin was sewing. “The
snow’s melting outside, and he’ll track it all over
the house.”</p>

<p>“I guess he has already done so, Sallie,” said
Tom’s mother a little ruefully. “He’s half-way
upstairs now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>“Land sakes! And that carpet only just
cleaned! What terrible creatures boys are!”</p>

<p>“Not so very bad, Sallie,” replied Mrs. Baldwin
with a smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tom was coming up the stairs with
a rush, and when he reached the top he found
his mother in the hall waiting for him. He kissed
her affectionately, and then followed her into the
room from which she had emerged to greet him.</p>

<p>The apartment was a small front one, and contained
two sewing machines, and, from the cloth,
patterns, needles and thread scattered about, it did
not need a sign to tell that dressmaking was conducted
in it.</p>

<p>“Hello, Aunt Sallie!” exclaimed Tom, as he
prepared to sit down on a chair near the door.</p>

<p>“Mercy! Goodness me! Don’t sit there!”
cried Miss Sarah Ramsey, Tom’s maiden aunt, who
was called “Sallie” by Tom and by his mother.
“Look out, Thomas!”</p>

<p>“Why? What’s the matter? Is there a pin or
a needle in it?” asked Tom, as he paused and
looked apprehensively at the chair, which contained
some fluffy white material.</p>

<p>“Needle! Pin! Why, Thomas Jefferson Baldwin!
That’s the ruching for the neck of Mrs.
Anderson’s new dress, and if you had sat on that,
and crushed it, I don’t know what I’d have done,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and Aunt Sallie became positively pale over the
thought.</p>

<p>Tom knew she had been much wrought up over
the threatened calamity, for she never gave him
his full name—Thomas Jefferson Baldwin—unless
she was very serious indeed.</p>

<p>“Huh!” exclaimed the boy. “I didn’t think that
bunch of white stuff was anything.”</p>

<p>“There, Tom, I’ll take it out of the way,” said
his mother. “Now you can sit down and tell us
all about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and try and be quiet about it,” cautioned
his aunt. “When you talk so loud you make my
head ache, and my nerves are all unstrung now
with trying to get the sleeves in this waist. I never
saw such styles as they wear now-a-days.”</p>

<p>“Have you really got work, Tom?” asked Mrs.
Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, and a good job, too.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I hope it is in some place where you will have
a chance to advance, and improve yourself,” put
in Miss Ramsey quickly. “Boys need improving
very much, now-a-days.”</p>

<p>“Then this ought to be just the place for it,”
said Tom, with a laugh. “It’s in a book store,
and I expect, before long, I’ll know enough, from
reading the books, to become a school teacher or
a professor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>“That would be very nice,” remarked Tom’s
aunt, as if he really meant what he said.</p>

<p>“Have you really got a place in a book store,
Tom?” inquired his mother, as she threaded a
sewing machine, preparatory to doing some stitching.</p>

<p>“Yes, in Townsend’s Book Emporium, as it’s
called. It’s on Milk Street, and it’s one of the
largest book stores in Boston. I saw a sign out
‘Boy Wanted,’ and I went in. I didn’t expect to
get the place, for I’ve been disappointed so often
of late, but I made up my mind I’d try.</p>

<p>“Mr. Townsend—he’s a nice elderly gentleman—asked
me a lot of questions, and when I got
through answering them he told me to come to
work in the morning. Isn’t that good news?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is,” replied Mrs. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“How much will you get?” asked his aunt
anxiously. “When I was a girl, boys in book stores
didn’t get more than three dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“Times have changed since then,” declared
Tom, with a laugh. “I’m to get five dollars.
There’s only one bad thing about it, though.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Mrs. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“I’m only hired during the holiday rush. They
want a boy to help out, and that’s what I’m to do.
I’ll have to look for something else after the first
of the year. Still, it’s better than nothing, and
there are four weeks more of this year left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>“I wish it was a permanent place,” remarked
Tom’s mother. “But, of course, as you say, it’s
better than nothing. Perhaps if you do well, they
may keep you permanently.”</p>

<p>“I hope they do, mother. But have you any
work that you want me to take home?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Tom. Mrs. Anderson’s dress isn’t
quite finished. There is more work on it than I
thought there would be, and it is going to take me
a day longer.”</p>

<p>“That means you won’t make so much money
then,” said Tom, soberly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so. If I had it finished I could
sew on that skirt for Mrs. Thompson, and she is
prompt pay.”</p>

<p>“I can’t sew as fast as I once could,” remarked
Tom’s aunt. “I’m afraid I’m not much help to
you, Jeanette.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you are!” exclaimed Mrs. Baldwin,
kindly. “I don’t know what I’d do without you—and
Tom.”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t anything for me to do then,”
went on the lad, “I think I’ll get something to eat.
I didn’t have any dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No; I saved the money for car fare, as I
didn’t know how far I’d have to go before I struck
a job. Then, when I got this one in the book store,
I thought I might as well come home and get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
bite as to go to a restaurant, so I’ve got the quarter
left.”</p>

<p>“But, Tom, you must take care of your health,”
said his mother. “Going without your dinner, to
save money, is poor economy. You can’t afford to
get sick, with two women to look after,” and she
smiled fondly at her son.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it didn’t hurt me, mother. But
I certainly am hungry now. Is there any jam
left?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you’ll find it in the pantry.”</p>

<p>Tom went downstairs, and was soon rattling
away at the dishes in the cupboard.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” exclaimed his aunt, as she
pointed to a patch of snow and mud left by Tom’s
shoes in the middle of the sewing room. “Isn’t
that awful! Oh, boys are such terrible creatures!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I have one,” declared Mrs. Baldwin
fondly, as she wiped up the mud with an old rag.
“There are worse things than muddy shoes,
Sallie.”</p>

<p>Miss Ramsey sighed, but said nothing. Meanwhile,
the “terrible boy” was satisfying a very
healthy appetite, thinking, between bites, of his
good luck in finding work.</p>

<p>For he needed employment very much. Tom
Baldwin’s father had died about three years before
this story opens, leaving his wife and son a small
house, in Boston, but no money. Of course, Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Baldwin could have sold the house, and lived for
a time on what she got for it, but she preferred to
keep it. She had been a good seamstress in her
younger days, and she determined to try to earn
her living by dressmaking.</p>

<p>But she soon found that dressmaking, as she
had seen it conducted when she was a girl in the
country, and the way it is done now-a-days, was
quite different. She could barely get enough to do
to make a living for herself and Tom, who was too
young to go to work, and who attended a public
school.</p>

<p>Finding she had not the skill necessary to compete
with the department stores and with modern
dressmakers, Mrs. Baldwin sent for her maiden
sister to come and help her. Miss Ramsey was a
better sewer than Mrs. Baldwin, but her health
was poor, and between them, the two women could
barely make both ends meet.</p>

<p>Much against her will Mrs. Baldwin had to
take Tom from school and put him to work. He
got a position in an office, where he earned three
dollars a week. This helped a little, and as he
proved efficient he was advanced until in about two
years he was earning eight dollars.</p>

<p>Times seemed better then, for, having no house
rent to pay, Mrs. Baldwin got along fairly well on
Tom’s money, and what she and her sister could
earn. But the dressmaking business grew worse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
instead of better, and the two women had to depend
more and more on Tom.</p>

<p>Then came a dark day when the firm that Tom
worked for failed, and he and many others lost
their places. From then on the little family of
three had a hard struggle. Had it not been for
the sewing the women did, and which just managed
to keep them, the house would have had to
be sold.</p>

<p>Work was hard to get in Boston, that year, and
it seemed with the approach of winter, that times
were worse than ever. Tom tramped the streets
day after day, looking for a situation, but in vain,
although occasionally he managed to get odd jobs
to do.</p>

<p>Then came the unexpected, when he saw the
sign in front of the book store, applied, and was
taken. No wonder Tom felt happy as he rushed
home with the good news.</p>

<p>The boy was at Townsend’s Book Emporium
early the next morning. There were several other
clerks employed, and Tom was told by the proprietor,
Elmer Townsend, that his duties would be
to run on all sorts of errands, to sweep out the
store, dust the books, and, in a rush, wait on
customers.</p>

<p>“I want you to make yourself as familiar as possible
with the books,” said Mr. Townsend. “Here
is a catalogue, and I have marked on it just what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
part of the store each book is in. The price of
each book is written on the upper right-hand corner
of the first fly-leaf, but as it is in letters, instead
of figures, you will have to learn what the
letters mean.”</p>

<p>Tom thought it was a queer plan to mark the
selling-price in letters instead of figures, but he was
soon enlightened.</p>

<p>“That is done so customers will not know the
prices of books,” said his employer. “I take a
word of ten letters, and each letter represents a
figure from 1 to 0. Then, by combining the letters
I can make any figure I want. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>Tom said that he did, and he had soon mastered
the little problem so that he could, after a little
study, tell the selling-price of any book, by looking
at the small letters on the first page.</p>

<p>The book store was quite a large one. Tom
had never seen so many volumes in one room before,
except in a library, and he began to think he
had come to just the right place, for he was fond
of reading and study, and he made up his mind
he would have a good time perusing his favorite
volumes.</p>

<p>But if our hero had an idea that clerks in book
stores spend their time pleasantly in looking at pictures
and reading stories, he was soon disappointed.</p>

<p>He found himself ordered here and there by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
other clerks. He had to bring books from the
front of the store to the back, and from the back
to the front. He had to get out bundles of wrapping-paper,
and balls of twine. He had to dust
off long rows of volumes, and when a clerk was
trying to wait on two customers at once, Tom had
to tie up books to be sent to various addresses
given by the purchasers. The lad hoped he would
be sent out to do some delivering, but he learned
that the volumes went by a local express company,
with which Mr. Townsend had a yearly contract.</p>

<p>Tom was in the back part of the store, arranging
some pamphlets that had been scattered about,
when he saw an elderly gentleman walk slowly
along the aisle formed by the book tables, and
pausing before some historic volumes, take one
from the row on the shelves.</p>

<p>“Ha! Um! Here it is!” exclaimed the old
gentleman, as he peered through his spectacles at
the printed page. “I knew I was right. It isn’t
there! Here, boy!” he called suddenly, glancing
over the tops of his glasses at Tom. “Just you
hold this book open a minute, right there, and
keep your finger on this line,” and he held the
volume out to the lad. Wonderingly, Tom complied.</p>

<p>The queer customer ran his finger along the row
of books, took out another, leafed it over rapidly,
and uttered an exclamation. Then, placing this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
book down on a table, and holding it open with
one hand, he reached for a third volume, which he
extended to Tom.</p>

<p>“Open that at page twenty-one,” he said.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” replied the boy, “unless I let go of
this other book.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I forgot. Well, give me the first
book. I can keep two places at once.”</p>

<p>Tom passed it over, and the old gentleman now
had two books open before him.</p>

<p>“Have you got page twenty-one?” he asked
Tom, as he bent close over the opened books.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything on it about the ancient Hickhites
having used belladonna in fevers?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tom slowly, as he read down
the page. “This seems to be an account of how to
make a fruit cake.”</p>

<p>“A fruit cake! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“This is a cook book, sir,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“A cook book! Goodness me! I must have
picked up the wrong memoranda when I hurried
from the house.”</p>

<p>He rapidly searched through his pockets, and
produced a crumpled piece of paper.</p>

<p>“That’s what I did,” he announced. “I picked
up a memoranda made out by my sister-in-law.
It’s about buying a new cook book she saw advertised.
My memoranda was on the use of belladonna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
among the ancient Hickhites. I differed
from a certain historian, and I wanted to look it
up. I have taken her memoranda, and left mine.
Well, well, I must be losing my memory. I’m
sorry I bothered you.”</p>

<p>“It was no bother at all,” said Tom politely.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it. I hate to bother any one. Now
let me see. There was another book I wanted to
get. What was it about? I thought I would remember
it. I know I had it on my mind when I
was looking at the first volume of the new edition
of Motley’s Dutch Republic—um—er—well, I
can’t think. I’ll have to go back home and get my
list.”</p>

<p>He took the cook book from Tom, and placing
it, with the two other volumes, under his arm,
started to walk out of the store. At once there
flashed through Tom’s mind the idea that this was
a slick swindler, who had adopted this method of
stealing books.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” he called. “Shan’t I wrap
those books up for you?”</p>

<p>He thought this would be a polite way of calling
the attention of Mr. Townsend or some clerk
to the actions of the queer customer.</p>

<p>“What books?” asked the old gentleman innocently.</p>

<p>“Those under your arm.”</p>

<p>“Have I some books under my arm? Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
goodness gracious, so I have! I’m glad you called
my attention to them, young man, or I might have
walked off with them. My, my! but I am getting
to have a poor memory! To think of carrying
off books without paying for them!”</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing I caught him in time, or Mr.
Townsend might have blamed me,” thought Tom.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Townsend came to the rear of
the store. He caught sight of the old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Why, Dr. Spidderkins! How do you do?”
he exclaimed. “I am real glad to see you? What
can I show you to-day? I didn’t know you were
here, or I would have attended to you personally.”</p>

<p>“I guess I made a mistake,” said Tom to himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>TOM IS SUSPICIOUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glad</span> that he had not accused the old gentleman
of trying to steal the books, Tom moved away,
leaving his employer and Dr. Spidderkins in
earnest conversation. Tom could hear them talking
about rare editions, first folios, and books or
pamphlets that were out of print, and very
valuable.</p>

<p>“Here, boy, wrap up this bundle,” called a
clerk.</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Tom good-naturedly. “Shall
I bring it back to you?”</p>

<p>“No, mark this address on it, and put it where
the expressman will get it. It’s got to be delivered
to-day.”</p>

<p>“The new boy is better than the other one we
had,” observed a second clerk to the one from
whom Tom had just taken an order.</p>

<p>“He certainly is. I only hope he keeps it up.”</p>

<p>The rest of that morning Tom found himself
busily occupied. There came a little let-up in the
rush, about noon, and the lad ventured to ask the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
senior clerk something about the queer old man
who was still browsing away among the books.</p>

<p>“He is one of our best customers,” replied the
clerk. “His name is Dr. Lemuel Spidderkins.”</p>

<p>“Does he practise medicine?”</p>

<p>“He used to, but he is retired now, and about
all he does is to collect books. Hardly a day
passes but what he buys two or three here, or in
other book stores. He spends a lot of money that
way. You see he’s so forgetful he dare not risk
practising his profession.”</p>

<p>“He certainly is queer,” remarked Tom, and he
told the clerk his experience with the doctor.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” was the answer. “He often
comes in here, and walks off with three or four
books without paying for them. If we see him
we always politely call his attention to them. If
we don’t, it doesn’t matter, for he generally recollects
what he has done when he reaches home, and
he sends the money for them. Yes, he is very
eccentric.”</p>

<p>“Then I did the right thing,” said Tom, “when
I offered to wrap them up for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He and Mr. Townsend are great
friends. He has bought books of us for years.”</p>

<p>“Here—er—new boy—what’s your name!”
suddenly called the book store proprietor, from
where he stood talking to Dr. Spidderkins.
“Wrap these books up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>Tom hurried to his employer, and took several
large and heavy volumes which the old physician
had evidently selected from the shelves.</p>

<p>“Ah, there is the young man who helped me
look up some facts about—er—well now, isn’t
that queer, I can’t remember what it was about,”
said the doctor, as he caught sight of Tom. “Was
it about how the Egyptians used to worship cats?”</p>

<p>“It was about belladonna and fruit cake,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so it was. Yes, he was quite a help
to me—I mean he showed me that I had the wrong
memoranda,” went on the physician. “I must get
a secretary if my memory keeps on failing me.
But I must pay you for these books, Mr. Townsend.
I’ll take them right along with me, or I’ll
forget all about them.”</p>

<p>“Better let me send them,” suggested the proprietor
of the Emporium. “They’ll make quite a
heavy bundle.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better. Here is the money,”
and the doctor held out several bills.</p>

<p>“Do you want that book you have under your
arm?” asked Mr. Townsend with a laugh, pointing
to a small volume, almost hidden by the big
sleeve of the doctor’s coat.</p>

<p>“Have I a book there? Why, bless my soul,
so I have! I remember now, I took it down to
look up a certain fact about how the Chinese use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
opium to deaden pain in sickness. It is just like
a book I have, only mine is an earlier edition. I
think I will take this. You may wrap it up with
the others. Queer, how forgetful I am becoming.
Now be sure those books are up to my house to-night.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be there,” Mr. Townsend assured the
physician, as Tom went to the counter to wrap
them up.</p>

<p>Dr. Spidderkins took his departure, and soon
after this, Tom was told he could go out and get
some lunch. He did not eat an elaborate meal and
was soon back at his place.</p>

<p>During the afternoon he went on a number of
errands, arranged several shelves of books, dusted
off long rows of volumes, and waited on one or
two customers.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to learn the book business,”
thought the lad proudly, after he had made his
third sale without an error. True they were only
small ones, involving the purchase of a pad, a
pencil, and the last one being a small book, purchased
by a girl. But they meant a lot to Tom.</p>

<p>“It will be closing time in half an hour,” remarked
one of the younger clerks to Tom. “Do
you live far from here?”</p>

<p>“Not very. About half an hour’s walk. But
I thought you kept open late during the holidays?”</p>

<p>“We will, beginning next week. It will be ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
o’clock every night then, but we get supper
money.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p>“Here, what’s this!” suddenly exclaimed Mr.
Townsend, as he saw the bundle of books which
Tom had wrapped up for Dr. Spidderkins.
“Haven’t these books been called for by the expressman?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the clerk, in charge of that
part of the work.</p>

<p>“This will never do,” went on the proprietor.
“The doctor wants the books to-night. Call up
the express office and see if they are coming.”</p>

<p>The clerk put the telephone into operation, and
presently reported to Mr. Townsend:</p>

<p>“He says the man forgot to call on his afternoon
trip, and it’s too late now.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” exclaimed Mr. Townsend.
“Those books must go to Dr. Spidderkins to-night,
or he’ll be very much disappointed, and he’s too
good a customer to disappoint. Tom, you had
better jump on a car and take them to him. Do
you know your way around the Back Bay district?”</p>

<p>The Back Bay district is the section of Boston
where are located the residences of the rich, and
it is quite exclusive.</p>

<p>“I guess I can find the place, sir,” said Tom
confidently, though he had only been in the locality
a few times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>“Well, here is your car fare. Be careful of the
books now, as some of them are quite expensive.
Be on hand early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Tom, as he put on his overcoat,
and with the bundle of books, which were
quite heavy, he started off.</p>

<p>He was soon in the Back Bay district, and a
little inquiry enabled him to find the doctor’s house.</p>

<p>“My, it’s a big place!” exclaimed Tom. “He
must have money to live in a house like that.”</p>

<p>He went up the front steps and rang the bell.
The door was presently opened by a woman, and,
in the light that streamed out into the darkness
from the hall, Tom saw that she was about middle
age, and that her features were rather sharp and
hard. Her face was not made more attractive by
the way her hair was arranged, for it was drawn
tightly back on both sides of her head.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” she asked snappishly.
“We don’t want to buy anything, and if
you’re the boy from the grocery you’re too late
with the stuff, and you must go round to the back
door. I can’t have tradesmen coming to the front
door.”</p>

<p>“These are some books Dr. Spidderkins purchased
to-day,” replied Tom. “I brought them,
because the expressman forgot to call.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Books?” asked a voice from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
within, that the boy recognized as the doctor’s.
“Who has books for me?”</p>

<p>Tom caught a glimpse of the elderly gentleman.
He was in his slippers and a dressing gown, and
his arms were so full of books that he could not
have carried another one.</p>

<p>“They are books from Mr. Townsend,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Come right in,” invited the doctor.
“I was wondering why they didn’t arrive. Come
right in with them, my boy. I want to look up
something about a certain rare plant——”</p>

<p>“He’ll do nothing of the kind!” interrupted the
woman. “I guess I’m not going to have snow
tracked into my house! Besides, you know you
started to go to supper, and there you are puttering
over those books. Oh, Lemuel, you’re so forgetful!”</p>

<p>“So I am! So I am,” admitted the doctor in
a queer sort of voice. “I remember now, I did
start to go to supper. I knew it was something
I ought to do. I’m glad you reminded me. I’ll
eat at once,” and, placing the books he was holding
on a chair in the hall, the old gentleman turned
back.</p>

<p>“Leave the books here,” said the woman to
Tom. “Are there any charges?”</p>

<p>“No; everything is paid.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and she abruptly shut the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>“Rather a cool reception,” murmured Tom.
“My, but she’s cross! I shouldn’t like to live with
her. I wonder how the doctor stands it, he’s so
quiet and studious? I wonder if she’s his wife?
No, she can’t be. The clerk said he wasn’t married.
She must be a housekeeper, or some relation.
My, but she seems to be able to make him
do just as she likes! The idea of not letting him
take his own books that he bought and paid for.
I guess he’s so easy that she has him under her
thumb.”</p>

<p>The time came when this was demonstrated to
Tom, even more forcibly than it was on this
occasion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>BUSY DAYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> was on hand so early at the book store the
next morning that he found the Emporium had
not yet opened. He had to stand out in the street,
until the porter came along to unlock the door.</p>

<p>“You’re early; ain’t you?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; I didn’t know exactly what time I had to
begin, so I thought I’d get here as soon as I could.
Where will I find a broom? I have to sweep out
the place.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get you one. You want to sprinkle damp
sawdust on the floor, and cover up all the books
on the tables, so they won’t get dusty. Mr. Townsend
is a very particular man.”</p>

<p>“I believe he is, but I like him—what little I
have seen of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll find he’s all right,” went on the
porter, as he opened the door, and showed Tom
where to find a broom. Then, while the man went
to the cellar to open up some cases of books that
had arrived late the previous afternoon, Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
began his sweeping. He had just finished, and
taken the cloths off the books, when the junior
clerk arrived. In a short time all the other employes
were at their places, and presently Mr.
Townsend came in.</p>

<p>“Ah, good-morning, Tom,” he said. “I see you
have the place in good shape for us. Did you
leave the books for Dr. Spidderkins?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, a very fine man he is, very fine indeed,
if he is a trifle eccentric. Did he say anything to
you?”</p>

<p>“Not very much. He said something about
waiting for the books.”</p>

<p>“I hope they were not too late.”</p>

<p>“I went as quickly as I could with them.”</p>

<p>“I know you did, Tom. I mean I hope I sent
you off with them in time. The doctor likes to
have things the minute they are promised, though,
often, after he has them, he forgets all about them.
Was he much put out?”</p>

<p>“Not very. I didn’t have a chance to say much
to him, as the lady who answered the door told
the doctor it was time for his supper.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I dare say he had forgotten all about it.
That’s his way. What did the woman say? She
is his sister-in-law, I believe, though she has married
a second time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>Tom related as much of the conversation as he
could remember.</p>

<p>“Hum,” mused the bookseller. “She’s a strange
woman—very strange. Well, I guess the books
got there in time. Now, Tom, I want you to go
on an errand for me.”</p>

<p>When Tom got back from having taken some
books to a customer who was stopping at the
Parker House, he found the Emporium a busy
place. There were a number of customers present,
for the holiday rush was on, and all the clerks,
and Mr. Townsend, were engaged in showing
books, or wrapping up parcels.</p>

<p>Seeing that Mr. Townsend was busy, Tom decided
to defer for the present reporting on the
result of his errand. He hung up his coat and
hat, and as there seemed to be nothing else for
him to do, he proceeded to tidy up a table of small
booklets, that was usually in disorder, as customers
were continually looking over the stock.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged he was approached
by a young man, whose clothes were of expensive
cut and material.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, in a peculiar
drawling accent, “but would you kindly get me a
volume of Browning! I can’t seem to locate it
amid all the maze of books here, and all the clerks
seem to be engaged. I presume I am right in assuming
that you are employed here?”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p024.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“Browning, the ball player!” exclaimed the young man.<br />

<span class="illoright"><i>Page <a href="#Page_25">25</a>.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>“Oh, yes, I work here,” answered Tom, who
paid little attention to accent. “But I’ve only been
here two days, and I don’t know much about the
books yet.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you can’t find for me a volume
of Browning?”</p>

<p>“I guess I can,” said Tom confidently. “I’ll
look in my special catalogue,” and he produced
the one Mr. Townsend had arranged for him.
“Browning, the baseball player, you mean, don’t
you?” he asked, for there was an athlete of that
name, who had made quite a reputation for himself
in the New England circuit that fall.</p>

<p>“Browning, the ball player!” exclaimed the
young man, as if horrified.</p>

<p>“Yes, the one that played short. He’s got the
highest batting average——”</p>

<p>“Don’t! Don’t, my dear young man; don’t I beg
of you,” spoke the customer, waving his hands.
“Baseball is such—such——”</p>

<p>“It’s a bully game!” exclaimed Tom, enthusiastically.
“I used to be captain of a team, when I
went to school. Tim Browning——”</p>

<p>“No, no! I mean Browning, the poet,” said the
young man hastily. “I want a volume of his
verses to send to a young lady. She is very fond
of him. So am I.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Tom suddenly, much enlightened.
“I thought you meant the other Browning. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
looking for the book among the sports. I’ll turn
to poetry. Yes, here it is,” he added a moment
later, as he found it in the catalogue. “I’ll get it
for you.”</p>

<p>He got several different styles of the poet’s work
and handed them to the young man.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is what I want!” he exclaimed.
“Don’t you think his poetry is simply perfect?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t care much for poetry,” replied
Tom, who, since he worked in a book store, did
not want to confess that he had never read a line
of Browning.</p>

<p>“Not care for poetry! Not an admirer of
Browning! You have missed much, my young
friend,” murmured the customer. “I will take this
copy,” he went on, selecting an expensive one and
handing Tom the money.</p>

<p>“I don’t much care whether he buys poetry or
books on sport as long as I sell ’em,” thought the
lad as he wrapped up the book. “Five dollars for
a book! Whew! I work a week for that. But
I’m glad I sold it to him.”</p>

<p>The young man went out, fondly holding the
volume of verse to his side. Tom went on arranging
the booklets, but presently he had to stop to
wait on a lady who wanted a fairy story for her
little girl. Here Tom was more at home, and he
found the lady quite ready to defer to his judgment
as to what sort of a book was best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>Presently a young lady appealed to Tom to find
for her a book on philosophy, and though the boy
could hardly pronounce the title of it, he managed
to locate it.</p>

<p>All that day Tom was kept busy, and he was acquiring
more confidence in himself with every sale
he made. At the close of the day, when Mr. Townsend
looked over the slips made out by the different
clerks, he congratulated Tom on the success
he had had.</p>

<p>“I hope he keeps me after the holidays are
over,” thought our hero. “That’s what I want,
a good, steady job, so I can earn money, and then
mother and Aunt Sallie won’t have to work so
hard.”</p>

<p>Toward the end of that week Dr. Spidderkins
paid another visit to the Emporium. He wandered
in, and was soon examining volumes in that part
of the shop given over to rare and costly books.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed as Tom passed him on his
way to get some wrapping-paper. “Here is just
what I have been looking for. It is a rare old copy
of Shakespeare. When did this come in? Why,
bless my soul! If it isn’t the boy who prevented
me from carrying off books without paying for
them the other day,” he added as he recognized
Tom. “How are you, young man?”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“I must have this book,” went on the old doctor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
“Let’s see—it will just match that volume of Milton
I bought the same day I got the copy of
Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. No, it wasn’t,
either. It was the day I bought Darwin’s volume
on evolution, or the day after. I declare, I can’t
remember which. But I must take this book along
with me. What’s the price?”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars,” answered Tom, after a look at
the mystic letters on the fly-leaf.</p>

<p>“Ah, very reasonable—very reasonable, indeed.”</p>

<p>Tom thought it very unreasonable, for the book
was an old one, and he knew of whole shelvesful
of brand-new books at much lower prices than that.
Dr. Spidderkins, however, seemed to think he had
a bargain.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it,” he said, putting his hand in his
pocket. Then a blank look came over his face.
“Bless my soul, I’ve lost my pocketbook!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Lost it?” repeated Tom. “Do you think you
dropped it here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure. Maybe I left it at
home. I’m so forgetful.”</p>

<p>“We have a telephone here—you could call up
your house and ask if it’s there,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“So I could. I never thought of that. But I
can’t talk very well over the wire, and my sister-in-law
can’t hear me as well as she can some persons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Suppose you call up for me? I’ll give you
the number. It’s 2256 Back Bay.”</p>

<p>“I’ll call up for you,” said Tom. “Shall I wrap
up this book?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll take it, anyhow, and send Mr. Townsend
the money. Queer I can’t remember when I
last had my pocketbook.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>STRANGE ACTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> experience Tom had once had, as a clerk
in a grocery store, where he took orders over the
telephone, had made him fairly expert in the use
of the instrument. He soon got the aged doctor’s
house on the wire, and was inquiring of Mrs. Barton
Sandow (which the physician gave as his sister-in-law’s
name) whether the pocketbook had been
left there.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s here,” answered Mrs. Sandow shortly.
“He forgot it, as usual. Tell him he left it
on the breakfast-table. Why, is he in trouble?”</p>

<p>“No; only he wants to buy some books, and he
hasn’t the money with him,” answered Tom politely.</p>

<p>“Well, tell him to be sure and not forget to
come home to dinner,” said Mrs. Sandow, as she
hung up the receiver with a click that snapped in
Tom’s ear.</p>

<p>“What does she say?” asked the old doctor.</p>

<p>“It’s there,” answered the boy. “And she wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
you to be sure not to forget to come home to dinner.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not. I’ll start right away, and then I can’t
forget. But I must tell Mr. Townsend about this
book. I remember once I took a volume without
paying for it—let me see, it was the same day
I picked up a rare copy of Bacon’s works—and I
forgot to send the money for a week, I got so interested
reading it. I want him to send after the
money for this, in case I don’t forward it right
away.”</p>

<p>Tom found the book-store proprietor and told
him of Dr. Spidderkins’ desires.</p>

<p>“Tell him to take the book, and welcome,” was
the reply Mr. Townsend sent back. “He can take
all the books he wants. He is good for them.”</p>

<p>The doctor left, after insisting that a messenger
must be sent to his house that evening for the ten
dollars, in case he did not send it sooner.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better stop up and see the doctor,
Tom,” said Mr. Townsend, when it came closing
time. “He hasn’t sent the money, and, while
I know he’ll pay it, he always likes to have things
done just as he requests. I don’t want to offend
him. So just take a run up there. You know
where the place is now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Shall I bring back the money to-night?”</p>

<p>“No; fetch it with you in the morning. I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
you know that, beginning next week, we shall
keep open quite late, on account of the Christmas
trade?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you don’t. The boy who had the
place you now have left on account of that.”</p>

<p>Tom made up his mind it would take a good
deal more than that to make him give up his job.</p>

<p>He took a car for the Back Bay district, and
arrived at the Spidderkins mansion about seven
o’clock. His knock was answered by the woman
he now knew to be Mrs. Sandow.</p>

<p>“Well?” she asked ungraciously.</p>

<p>“I called to see Dr. Spidderkins.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“I was told to collect ten dollars for some
books.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Those everlasting books!” exclaimed
Mrs. Sandow. “My brother-in-law spends more
money on them than he does on the house. It’s
all foolishness!”</p>

<p>She opened the door a little wider, and Tom
took this for an invitation to enter.</p>

<p>“Are your feet clean?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I wiped them carefully on the mat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you half did. I never saw a
boy yet with clean feet. Wait here, and I’ll tell
the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Ah, good evening, my lad,” exclaimed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
aged physician, as, with his spectacles half-way
down on his nose, and holding a book in each hand,
he came out to greet Tom. “You are from the
printer’s, aren’t you? Have you the proofs of
my new book on ‘The Influence of Environment
in Nervous Diseases’?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’m not from the printer’s,” said
Tom. “I came about the ten dollars, for Mr.
Townsend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to be sure. How stupid of me. I
wonder where my pocketbook is?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you find it?”</p>

<p>“Find it? Did I lose it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you remember me telephoning
about it for you, when you were in the store?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to be sure. Now I know who you are.
Dear, dear, I am getting to have a bad memory,
I’m afraid!”</p>

<p>He already had it, Tom thought, but the old
gentleman was such a delightful character, that
the boy could not help liking him.</p>

<p>“Come right into the sitting-room,” went on the
doctor. “Let me see, your name is Theopholus,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it’s Tom Baldwin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I recollect now. Well, Tom, just
sit down a minute, and I’ll get the money. Please
don’t disturb any of the books or papers. I’m
writing another book on how to avoid taking colds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and I’m looking up all the authorities about that
form of disease.”</p>

<p>The table was covered with books and papers,
and Tom took a seat far enough away so that there
would be no danger of disturbing them.</p>

<p>“Eliza, have you seen my pocketbook?” Dr.
Spidderkins called, as he left the room.</p>

<p>“I put it right on top of your desk, where you
couldn’t help but see it,” answered Mrs. Sandow.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course; I remember now. I have
it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>The doctor came back into the sitting-room.
He was followed a moment later by a tall, dark
complexioned man, whose eyes, as Tom noticed at
a glance, seemed to be continually shifting about.</p>

<p>“Ah, Barton, are you going to sit here and
read?” asked the doctor pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I was going to, but you’ve got your confounded
papers all over the table, so I don’t see how I can
very well,” answered the man, in surly tones.</p>

<p>“I’ll make a place for you at once,” said the
doctor hastily, sweeping the papers to one side.</p>

<p>“You needn’t bother,” was the man’s ungracious
remark. “I can go somewhere else. I wish you,
wouldn’t make such a muss.”</p>

<p>“But this is about my new book.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what it is.”</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to shrink away from Mr.
Barton Sandow, and Tom felt a natural resentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
against a man who would speak so ungraciously
to an aged person.</p>

<p>“Allow me to present a friend of mine to you,”
went on the physician courteously. “This is Tom
Baldwin, Mr. Sandow. Tom, or I suppose I
should say Thomas, this is my brother-in-law.
That is he is a sort of brother-in-law. His wife
was my brother’s wife, but my brother has been
dead several years, and his wife married again.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t go into the whole family history,”
said Barton Sandow surlily. “How are you?” he
added to Tom, but his tone of voice was such that
he might as well have told the boy he did not care
whether he was well or ill.</p>

<p>“I—I wasn’t going to,” said the doctor gently.
“I only thought—I—er—and—er—” he seemed
to forget what he was going to say.</p>

<p>“Did you call on business?” asked Mr. Sandow
suddenly, looking at Tom. “Dr. Spidderkins evidently
has forgotten what it is about,” he added
with a sneer.</p>

<p>“I’m from Mr. Townsend’s book store,” was
the boy’s reply.</p>

<p>“That’s it. I knew it was something about
books,” said the doctor with an uneasy laugh.
“Thank you for reminding me. I had forgotten.
I must pay you that ten dollars.”</p>

<p>He drew out his pocketbook, and began fumbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
with it, for his eyesight was clearly not of
the best.</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought I had a ten-dollar bill somewhere
in it,” he said, as he handed Tom an envelope.
“I sealed it up in this, and meant to send
it, but I forgot it. But there ought to be more
money in my wallet. I left fifty dollars in it this
morning, and now there are only fifteen. I wonder
what has become of the rest?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I took it?” asked Mr. Sandow,
almost savagely.</p>

<p>“Why—er—no—of course not,” answered the
old doctor, looking over the tops of his spectacles.
“I only thought——”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you thought!” exclaimed
the other quite fiercely. “First thing you know
you’ll be accusing me or my wife of stealing money
from you. ’Liza, come here!” he called.</p>

<p>His wife stood in the door.</p>

<p>“What is it, Barton?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The doctor has missed some money from his
pocketbook, and he accuses us of taking it.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Nothing of the sort!” said the
physician quickly. “I—I didn’t mean that. I—I
thought I had more money than I have. But—er—I
must——”</p>

<p>“You spent it, and you’ve forgotten all about
it,” declared Mrs. Sandow with a hard laugh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
“You’re always doing that, Lemuel. Didn’t you
pay for two tons of coal this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I guess I must have, but I don’t
recollect about it. Did any coal come?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Mrs. Sandow, quickly,
and Tom, looking up suddenly, saw her making
some kind of a motion to her husband.</p>

<p>“Then that must be where the money went,”
agreed the doctor. “I’m sorry I’m so forgetful.
It may interfere with my new book. I don’t mind
the money, but I like to know where I spend it.”</p>

<p>“Probably you wasted it on books,” said Mr.
Sandow, half growling out the words.</p>

<p>“No, I never waste money on books, and I only
spent ten dollars for one to-day.”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars for a book!” gasped Mrs. Sandow.
“You’ll be in the poorhouse soon, at that
rate.”</p>

<p>“It was a very rare volume,” pleaded her
brother-in-law. “I—I couldn’t very well let it go.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” sniffed the woman. “You’ll wish
you had that money some day. But it’s time you
went to bed. You’re forgetting it’s past your
hour.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked the doctor humbly. “I knew
there was something I ought to remember. Well,
good-night, Tom—is it Tom? Oh, yes, I remember
now. Perhaps you’ll have some more books
to deliver for me next week. I must get some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
more authorities on colds,” and the aged gentleman
tottered off, shaking his white head, as though
vainly trying to remember something.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s all that need detain you,” said
Mr. Sandow rather roughly to Tom. “We close
up early here.”</p>

<p>“Yes; my business is finished,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>As he went down the stone steps, our hero wondered
at the queer actions of Mr. and Mrs. Sandow,
for they seemed to have some strange control
over the aged doctor.</p>

<small>CHARLEY GROVE’S IDEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hey</span>, Tom!” hailed a voice, as our hero got
off the street car, near his home. “Where are
you going?”</p>

<p>Tom turned, to behold his chum, Charley Grove,
whom he had not seen since going to work in the
book store.</p>

<p>“Going home,” replied Tom. “Where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“Same place. Haven’t seen you in over a week.
Where have you been keeping yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a new job,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Down in Townsend’s Book Emporium.”</p>

<p>“What doin’? Readin’ books?”</p>

<p>“Not much. Don’t get any time for that.
We’re busy on account of the holidays. What are
you doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got a new job, and it’s fine.”</p>

<p>“What at?”</p>

<p>“I run the telephone switchboard in a broker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
office. Short hours and good pay. I get ten a
week. All I got was eight in my last place.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I got, before the firm failed. Now
I only get five.”</p>

<p>“You ought to strike for more money.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t do much good. I’m only an extra
hand during the holidays. I’ll be lucky if I stay
there after the first of the year.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad. You ought to learn to be a
telephone boy. I know two or three who make
more money than I do.”</p>

<p>“Is it hard to learn?”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t so very easy, and if you’re in a
busy office like mine it keeps you on the jump.
It’s no fun to have all three members of the firm
trying to get connections at once, and half a dozen
parties on the outside wanting to talk to the partners
to give orders to sell or buy stocks. I couldn’t
do it at first, and I got all mixed up, but I can
work it all right now.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a place like that,” said Tom.
“I used to take orders over the telephone in the
grocery store.”</p>

<p>“Bein’ on a private exchange is a heap different
from that,” said Charley, as he walked along
beside Tom.</p>

<p>“Do you think there’s a place in your office for
another boy?” asked Tom, rather wistfully, as he
thought of the good salary his chum was getting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>“I don’t believe so. But I’ll keep my ears open,
and if I hear of anything in that line, I’ll let you
know.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. I’ll have to look for something
after Christmas, and I’m afraid I’ll have a
hard task finding anything.”</p>

<p>“Where were you when I saw you getting off
the car?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“I’d been over in the Back Bay section, to collect
some money from a Dr. Spidderkins.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Spidderkins! Why he used to be our doctor,”
said Charley. “He’s too old to practice now,
but I remember my mother saying she had him
for me, when I was a baby.”</p>

<p>“He’s rather a queer character,” commented
Tom. “He’s always forgetting things.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had his rocks! He’s got slathers of
money.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look rich. His clothes aren’t very
good, but maybe that’s because he spends so much
on books.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s got lots to spend,” said the other boy.
“I heard my dad say Dr. Spidderkins was worth
close to half a million. But I guess he doesn’t have
much fun out of it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s always studying some queer subject
or other, or writing books or papers for the scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
magazines. And then I guess his sister-in-law
doesn’t treat him any too good.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right there,” agreed Tom.
“She seems to make fun of him, because he’s so
forgetful.”</p>

<p>“From what I hear, though,” went on Charley,
“his short memory just suits Mr. Sandow—that’s
his sister-in-law’s second husband.”</p>

<p>“Suits him? How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got an idea,” went on Tom’s chum,
“that Sandow would like to get control of part of
Dr. Spidderkins’ money. He’s got slathers of it,
as I said, and I don’t believe he knows where it all
is. He’s as careless about cash as he is about other
things, dad says. Forgets what he does with his
rocks.”</p>

<p>“How do you know Sandow would like to get
hold of it,” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, Sandow does some business through our
firm. Not much, though. He’s a ‘piker.’”</p>

<p>“What’s a ‘piker’?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we call a chap that buys a few
shares of stock at a time. Small business, you
know. Well, Sandow does a little business with
us, and I heard him telephoning to our junior
partner one day, giving an order for a few shares.
Mr. Fletcher, that’s the junior partner, asked him
why he didn’t buy more, and I heard Sandow say
he couldn’t, as he didn’t have the money. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
I heard him laugh, sort of queer-like, and he said
he might have more soon. Mr. Fletcher asked
him where he was going to get it, and Sandow
said he expected to get it from a friend of the
family. Mr. Fletcher asked him if he meant Dr.
Spidderkins, and Sandow only laughed. That’s
all I heard.”</p>

<p>“Can you hear what both people say over the
wire?”</p>

<p>“Sure, when you cut in on the switchboard. I
have to keep listening, to tell when they’re finished,
’cause there’s most always somebody waitin’ for
our wire.”</p>

<p>“So you think Sandow is trying to get part of
the old doctor’s money?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s my idea,” replied Charley. “I guess
it wouldn’t be so hard, either, for the doctor’s so
forgetful he might have a hundred or five hundred
dollars one minute, and not find it the next,
and he wouldn’t know what become of it.”</p>

<p>There came at once to Tom’s mind the scene
he had witnessed that evening in the doctor’s home—the
confusion about the money, and the puzzled
air of the physician—when he could not find it in
his wallet.</p>

<p>“Well, this is my street,” announced Charley,
as he paused on a corner. “Come on over some
night and see a fellow.”</p>

<p>“I will, only I can’t until after the holidays.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
We’re going to keep open evenings beginning next
week.”</p>

<p>“That’s tough. You ought to be a telephone
boy, and get done at three o’clock. I went to a
moving picture show this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could go. But let me know if you
hear of a chance for me, Charley.”</p>

<p>“I will, Tom. Hope you keep your job.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I want to, since I’ve heard
about yours,” replied Tom with a laugh. “Good-night.”</p>

<p>Tom hurried on to his home. As he reached
the steps, and felt for the key of the door, he
gave a sudden start. The envelope containing the
ten dollars which Dr. Spidderkins had given him,
and which he had put in his pocket, was gone!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>OUT OF WORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thinking</span> he might not have looked in the
right pocket, Tom made a hasty search through
all the others.</p>

<p>“No use,” he said dolefully, “it’s gone! I must
have dropped it after I left the house. What’s to
be done?”</p>

<p>The situation was serious for the lad. He
wished he had been more careful, but he had been
so engaged in thinking of the queer actions of Mr.
and Mrs. Sandow, and in talking to Charley Grove,
that he had given little thought to the money.</p>

<p>“Mr. Townsend will think I have stolen it, when
I go to him in the morning, and say I’ve lost it,”
murmured Tom. “I wish I had been more particular.
Maybe there was a hole in my pocket.”</p>

<p>He looked, but there was none, for Mrs. Baldwin
attended carefully to her son’s clothes.</p>

<p>“This is certainly a pickle!” exclaimed the boy
to himself softly. “I wonder what I’d better do?
Maybe if I go back the way I came I’ll find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
envelope lying in the street. It was a good-sized,
white one, and I can easily see it.”</p>

<p>“But maybe I dropped it in the car,” he added.
“No, I don’t believe I could have done that, or
some of the passengers or the conductor would
have seen it on the floor, and told me about it. I
must have lost it either before I got on the car, or
afterward. I’ll walk back to where I met Charley,
and see if it’s there.”</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o’clock now, and as Tom
looked up at the silent little house, where his
mother and aunt were doubtless sleeping, he wondered
if he had better go in and tell his parent
about the loss, and inform her that he was going
to look for the money.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not do that,” he decided. “She’ll
only worry about it, and she has troubles enough.
I’ll hurry as much as I can, and get back as soon as
possible. Still, if I’m not in by midnight she may
worry too. But then I told her I was likely to be
late any night now, for I might have to deliver
books in the suburbs. I guess she won’t worry if
I don’t go in right away.”</p>

<p>Deciding that this was the best plan, Tom
descended the steps of his home, and hurried back
over the route he had taken from the car. How
eagerly he scanned the pavement, looking for that
white, square envelope! Every scrap of paper he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
saw made his heart flutter, until he came close to
it, and saw that it was not what he sought.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s where I took the car,” he said,
as he reached the corner where he had alighted.
“Either I didn’t drop it along this way, or if I did,
some one has picked it up. Now for the second
part of my search.”</p>

<p>He waited for a car to come along, to take him
back to Dr. Spidderkins’ house, and it was a cold,
lonesome wait for Tom, who felt quite miserable
over what had happened. To his delight he saw
on the car the same conductor with whom he had
ridden about an hour before. The man was on
the return trip.</p>

<p>“Did you find an envelope in the car, after I
left?” asked Tom eagerly, as he got aboard, and
told the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Didn’t find anything but an old lunch box,
and there was nothing in it,” said the conductor.</p>

<p>“Then I must have dropped it before I got on
the car,” decided Tom.</p>

<p>Arriving at the place where he had first boarded
the electric vehicle, he alighted and hurried over
the ground toward the house of the eccentric doctor.
No sign of a white envelope greeted his
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m going to ask if it’s in the house,” the boy
said to himself, as he stood in front of the big,
dark mansion. “I might have let it slip when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
thought I put it in my pocket, and perhaps they
picked it up on the floor. Though if Mr. and Mrs.
Sandow did, they’re likely to keep it, if what
Charley Grove says is true.”</p>

<p>Tom rang the bell. It seemed like a quarter of
an hour before some one opened a window over his
head and called:</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter? Is it a telegram?”</p>

<p>“I’m from Townsend’s book store,” replied
Tom. “I came——”</p>

<p>“What! More books!” exclaimed a voice Tom
recognized as Mrs. Sandow’s. “You can’t leave
’em here to-night. Everybody’s to bed long ago.
You’ll have to come back in the morning.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any books,” said Tom. “I
dropped the envelope with the ten-dollar bill the
doctor gave me, and I thought maybe it might be
in the house. Would you mind looking?”</p>

<p>“That’s a likely story!” sneered Mr. Sandow,
joining his wife at the window. “You probably
stole that money, and now you want us to help you
lie about it. Clear out of here!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal the money!” exclaimed Tom. “I
lost it! Will you please look down in the sitting-room,
or have Dr. Spidderkins do so?”</p>

<p>“The doctor’s asleep, and I’m not going to disturb
him,” declared Mrs. Sandow.</p>

<p>“I guess not!” added her husband. “Now clear
out of here, and don’t disturb us any more. You’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
a nuisance, with your books and things! I’ll put a
stop to this buying of trash!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What is it? Is it a
burglar after my rare books?” inquired Dr. Spidderkins,
coming suddenly to the window, behind
Mr. and Mrs. Sandow. He leaned out, and Tom
could see, in the light of an electric arc lamp in
front of the house, that the doctor was dressed,
and had on his spectacles, as if he had been sitting
up reading.</p>

<p>“Go back to bed!” called the woman.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been to bed. I must have forgotten
to go,” answered the doctor. “I was reading an
account of how the Romans invaded England. It’s
in a very rare first edition of——”</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was cut off, as Mr.
Sandow slammed the window down.</p>

<p>“They don’t want him to speak to me,” thought
Tom. “I wonder what’s the matter with that
couple? They seem to want the doctor to do just
as they say.”</p>

<p>An instant later the window was raised again,
and the aged physician looked out.</p>

<p>“Did you say some one was stealing my books?”
he asked. “Are you a policeman? I’m much
obliged to you. I hope the fellow didn’t get my
first folio Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not a policeman! No books have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
stolen!” cried Tom. “I’m from Townsend’s book
store.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You’re Theopholus—no—I remember
now; you’re Tom Baldwin. Wait; I’ll be right
down. Have you some more books for me?”</p>

<p>Before the boy could answer, the window was
shut again, but in less than a minute the front
door opened, and Dr. Spidderkins, holding a candle
in his hand, for he liked that old-fashioned method
of going about the house after dark, was inviting
Tom to enter. The story of the mishap was soon
told.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe I might have dropped the
envelope here,” the boy finished.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” exclaimed Dr. Spidderkins,
as he reached for his pocketbook. He searched
hurriedly through it. Then he uttered an exclamation.
“There! It’s all my fault. I knew I’d
forget about it!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Tom hopefully.</p>

<p>“Why, I gave you the wrong thing! There
wasn’t any ten-dollar bill in that envelope!”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t?” and Tom’s heart grew light
again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p050.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">“Why, I gave you the wrong thing!” said Dr. Spidderkins.<br />

<span class="illoright"><i>Page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>.</i></span></p>

<p>“No. That envelope contained a list of books
I wanted Mr. Townsend to get for me. I meant
to send it back to him by whoever called for the
ten dollars. I put the envelope in the compartment
with the bill, so I would remember about it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Then my memory played me a trick, and I gave
you the envelope with the list, and not the bill.
So you haven’t lost much of anything, after all.
I can easily make out another list, and here is the
ten-dollar bill. Queer how that happened.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a good thing you didn’t give me
the money,” said Tom with a smile, “for I would
have lost it. But I’ll be careful this time.”</p>

<p>He placed the bill in an inner pocket, and then,
bidding the doctor good-night, Tom once more
started for home. This time he reached it in
safety, and he put the bill under his pillow when
he went to bed. He said nothing about the little
adventure to his mother or aunt, merely stating
that he had been out late because of some business
for his employer. Nor did he mention the happening
to Mr. Townsend.</p>

<p>The work at the book store became more exacting
as Christmas approached, and as customers increased,
Tom was kept busy from morning to
night. He had to run on many errands, and he
learned more of Boston than he had ever known
before.</p>

<p>He made many sales in the store, and several
times he waited on Dr. Spidderkins, but the physician
made no reference to Tom’s midnight visit.
Probably he forgot all about it ten minutes after
it occurred.</p>

<p>Christmas eve Tom was up until after midnight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
delivering books to late customers, and when he
got back to the store about one o’clock in the morning,
he found Mr. Townsend about to close up.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said his employer, “you’ve done very
good work for me, and I assure you I appreciate
it. We don’t open to-morrow, and here’s a little
remembrance for the Christmas season.”</p>

<p>He handed our hero a book of adventures that
Tom had long desired to possess.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” went on Mr. Townsend, “that I
won’t be able to keep you after this week. You
know I engaged you for the holiday rush, and
that’s over now, so I won’t need so many clerks. I
am sorry to have to let you go, as you suited me
very well.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” said Tom frankly, “but, of
course, I understood when you hired me that it
was for the holiday season. I only hoped you
could keep me.”</p>

<p>“So did I, but I find I can not. Your week will
not be up until Saturday, but as there will be little
to do, you need not come in that day, nor Friday,
though I will pay you for a full week. Here is
the money. Now if you want a reference, to get
another position, call on me. I will be glad to
speak a good word for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Townsend.”</p>

<p>“I think you can get work, somewhere,” went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
on the bookseller. “I wish I could keep you, but
I can’t. Times are too dull. Good-night, Tom.”</p>

<p>Tom went home with a heavy heart, in spite of
the fact that it was Christmas morning, and that a
book had been presented to him. He was out of
work, and he did not know where to look for a
situation.</p>

<small>LOOKING FOR A SITUATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Merry Christmas</span>!” called Mrs. Baldwin, as
she knocked on Tom’s door that morning. “Merry
Christmas, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, mother!” he answered. He
hurriedly dressed, trying to keep up a cheerful
spirit, but it was hard work. He went downstairs,
and handed to his mother and aunt each a pretty
little booklet, which he had purchased at the
Emporium at reduced prices.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom!” exclaimed his mother, “why didn’t
you save your money? I haven’t been able to get
anything for you except some new socks. You
needed them very much.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did, mother, and I couldn’t have anything
better,” answered the boy, giving his mother
a hug and a kiss.</p>

<p>“Here is a pair of woolen gloves I knitted for
you,” put in his aunt. “I’m sure they’re not as nice
as this Christmas book.”</p>

<p>“They’re a good deal more useful,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Tom. “Why, this is a pretty good Christmas,
after all, even if I have lost my job,” he said, deciding
this was a good time to break the unpleasant
news.</p>

<p>“Lost your job, Tom!” exclaimed Mrs. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Mercy sakes! Lost—your—job!” added his
aunt.</p>

<p>“Well, I sort of expected it,” the youth answered
ruefully, and he told how it had come
about.</p>

<p>“I rather hoped he might keep you on after
the holidays,” remarked Mrs. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“So did I,” said her son, “but, never mind, I’ll
get a place somewhere. Things are sure to be
lively after the first of the year, and that’s only a
week off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll manage to get along, somehow,” declared
Mrs. Baldwin slowly. She did not want
Tom to know how little money she had, nor what
a little sewing there was in prospect for her and
her sister.</p>

<p>But in spite of these drawbacks it was quite a
merry little Christmas for Tom and his relatives,
even though they had beef instead of turkey, and
no dessert at all.</p>

<p>Tom started off, early the next morning, to look
for work, but he found the Christmas spirit rather
a detriment than otherwise, for many places took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
advantage of the holidays and paid little attention
to business. The lad tramped the streets in vain,
and came home that night, tired and discouraged.</p>

<p>He awoke in the morning to find a foot of snow
on the ground, and more coming down.</p>

<p>“Here’s my work all cut out for me,” he said
gleefully. “Mother’s socks and Aunt Sallie’s
gloves will just come in handy to-day. I’ll turn
snow-shoveler.”</p>

<p>After he had cleaned the sidewalk in front of
his own house, he shouldered the shovel and
broom, and joined the army of men and boys that
had begun to gather to clear away the frozen crystals
that were still lazily floating down.</p>

<p>Whether the Christmas spirit induced householders
to be more liberal than usual, or whether
Tom worked extra hard he did not stop to consider,
but the fact was he earned three dollars that
day.</p>

<p>“This is better than working in a book store,”
he said gleefully, as he gave his mother a handful
of change that night. “I’d like this regular, I
would.”</p>

<p>“But being in a book store is so educational and
refining, Tom,” remarked his aunt.</p>

<p>“Shoveling snow buys more bread and butter,”
answered the matter-of-fact boy with a laugh.</p>

<p>He resumed his search for work the next day,
as there was no more snow to shovel, but everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
he applied he met with the reply that there
was nothing for him to do. All business seemed
to have taken a sudden drop after Christmas.</p>

<p>“It will be better after New Year’s,” decided
Tom. “I’ll sure get a job then.”</p>

<p>Anxiously he waited for January the second.
He started off early that morning, taking some
lunch with him, as he found he could get scarcely
anything to eat in a restaurant for the money he
could afford to pay. He bought a paper, and
turned to the column “Help Wanted.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see what firm offers boys the highest
wages,” he said. “That’s what I’m looking for.”</p>

<p>He saw several advertisements that seemed to
offer a good chance, but Tom was at this disadvantage—he
had to walk to the places, for he could
not afford car fare. In this way he arrived too
late in a number of cases, the positions having been
filled just before he presented himself.</p>

<p>“I must pick out the places that are nearest by,”
he decided, and he went over the list again. He
selected an advertisement of a firm on Tremont
Street, that wanted a boy to assist in packing.
Tom found it was a big crockery store.</p>

<p>“Have you had any experience in packing?”
asked the manager, to whom, after inquiring of
several clerks, he was referred.</p>

<p>“We moved once, and I helped them,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Tom, wondering what sort of packing was done in
the place.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid that would hardly do,” was
the answer. “We want a boy who has had experience
in packing dishes.”</p>

<p>“I think I could learn,” spoke the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we couldn’t risk it. Our dishes are
very valuable, and if a boy broke one or two it
would amount to more than his wages. We require
experienced help.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I learn by beginning to pack heavy
dishes, that wouldn’t break so easily, if I happened
to drop one?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p>Tom wondered how a boy was ever going to get
experience packing fine dishes, if he never had any
practice on heavy ones, but he did not think it
would do any good to ask the manager, so he left.</p>

<p>At the next place a boy was wanted to run
errands, but as the wages were only two dollars
a week, Tom knew he could not afford to take it,
for he would hardly make his expenses. Then he
saw an advertisement of a boy wanted in a machine
shop.</p>

<p>“That might do,” he mused. “I’m fond of machinery,
and I often used to go to the shop where
father worked.”</p>

<p>“We want a boy to learn the trade,” said the
foreman of the shop where Tom applied, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
where the machinery made so much noise that
every one had to shout to be heard. “It’s a good
trade, and you can earn good wages at it.”</p>

<p>“How much do you pay?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Pay? We don’t pay anything the first year,”
answered the foreman, in apparent surprise at the
question. “I thought you wanted to learn the
trade.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” said Tom, “but I want to live
while I’m learning it. A trade wouldn’t do me
much good if I starved to death, and I’d do that
if I didn’t get some money.”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t suit,” was the comment, as
the foreman turned back to the lathe which he had
stopped while he talked to Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” was our hero’s comment.</p>

<p>He had exhausted the possibilities of the advertising
list, so he strolled around in the streets
where there were many office buildings, hoping he
might see some boys he knew, who could tell him
where he might apply for work, or where he might
see that magical sign “Boy Wanted” hanging in
front of a store or office.</p>

<p>He did see two signs, but the places were meant
for smaller lads than Tom—boys who had parents
to support them—and who would be content with
two or three dollars a week.</p>

<p>“I guess this is going to be a poor year for
boys,” thought Tom, as he went over to a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
park, where, sitting on a bench, he ate his lunch.
He spent five cents for a cup of coffee and a bun
at a street stand, and felt somewhat better after
it, for the day was cold.</p>

<p>“There’s a big building,” mused the boy, as he
looked at one just across from the little park.
“There must be a couple of hundred offices in it.
Now they need boys in an office, and out of the
two hundred there ought to be a place for me.
I’m going to ask in every office in that building.”</p>

<p>Tom did not know how much of a task he had
set for himself, but he started bravely in, beginning
on the ground floor, and working his way
up.</p>

<p>In some places he was politely told that there
was no opening for him. In others he was gruffly
given the same information, though, by this time,
he was getting hardened to rebuffs.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve asked in twenty-five places,” he
mused. “Here goes for the twenty-sixth.”</p>

<p>He entered an office marked “Real Estate and
Insurance.” A rather pretty girl was pounding
away at a typewriter.</p>

<p>“Do you want a boy?” asked Tom, smiling, in
spite of his weariness.</p>

<p>“Do I want a boy?” she asked wonderingly.
“Why, no. Are you a messenger boy? I didn’t
ring for any.”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for work,” explained Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>“Oh, I see,” she answered kindly. “I don’t
know. I’ll ask——”</p>

<p>At that moment a man came from an inner
office. Tom started at the sight of him, for he
was Barton Sandow, the brother-in-law of Dr.
Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“Well,” fairly growled Mr. Sandow, “what do
you want here? I don’t want any books, even if
Dr. Spidderkins does waste his money on them.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any books,” replied Tom. “I called
to see if you wanted a boy. I’m looking for
work.”</p>

<p>The lad’s answer seemed to enrage the man.
He started toward our hero, his face flaming red
with passion.</p>

<p>“Who told you to come here?” he cried.</p>

<p>“No one; I just happened to come. I’m inquiring
in all the offices in the building.”</p>

<p>“Well, you clear out of here, you young gutter-pup!”
fairly shouted Barton Sandow. “I don’t
want a boy, and if I did I shouldn’t hire you! Get
out of here! Do you understand! Clear out, and
don’t you dare come in again!”</p>

<p>The pretty typewriter girl shrank back afrightened,
and Tom, not knowing what to make of the
outburst, opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong with Mr. Sandow,”
he said, for the needlessly cruel words rankled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
his mind. “There was no occasion for him to
speak like that. I pity Dr. Spidderkins, living with
that man. There’s something queer about it. I
wonder what it is?”</p>

<small>DR. SPIDDERKINS’ POCKETBOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> tried to keep up a cheerful spirit when he
went home that night, tired and discouraged with
his fruitless search for work.</p>

<p>“No luck, Tom?” asked his mother, who, in
spite of his efforts at concealment, could almost
read his thoughts.</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll find a place to-morrow, mother.
Is there any work I can take home for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; here is a skirt I have just finished for
Mrs. Wellderly, the minister’s wife. She is
usually good pay, and I have written her a little
note, asking to please send the money by you.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was earning money for you, mother.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Tom. I have had an unusual lot
of sewing to do lately, and we are making out
fairly well. Now here is the skirt. Carry it carefully.”</p>

<p>She handed the bundle to Tom, who grasped it
as if it was a package of books, placing it under
one arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>“Mercy! Goodness sakes alike! Don’t do
that!” cried his aunt.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Tom innocently.
“Am I spilling any of the fol-de-rols?”</p>

<p>“No; but you’ll crush the ruffle all out of
shape!” explained his mother. “Hold it this way,
Tom,” and she showed him how he ought to carry
the parcel.</p>

<p>Tom safely delivered his mother’s work, and
received the money from the minister’s wife.</p>

<p>“Tell your mother to call and see me,” the lady
said to the boy. “A friend of mine wants some
fine sewing done, and I think she would like Mrs.
Baldwin’s work.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Tom.</p>

<p>Refreshed by a good night’s sleep, though he
was awake a little longer than usual, wondering
what the day would bring forth, Tom arose early
the next morning, determined to leave no chance
untried to get a place to work. He looked over
the advertisements in the paper, and picked out
several.</p>

<p>He found, to his regret, however, that in most
of the places where boys or young men were
wanted, that experience in some line of industry
was necessary. This was particularly true of the
shops and stores. In the offices this was not quite
so requisite, but office positions were very scarce.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll try some of the book stores,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
thought Tom, when noon came, and he had had
no success. “I had a little experience there, and
it ought to be worth something. Any way,” he
added, as he smiled at the recollection, “I know
there are two Brownings, a poet and a baseball
player.”</p>

<p>He turned into Milk Street, where was located
Townsend’s Emporium, but he knew it was no use
to apply there. He recalled that there was a
second-hand book store, further down the street,
and he decided to try his luck there.</p>

<p>It was quite a different place from the neatly-kept
shop where he had formerly worked, and
there was a curious, musty smell about it, many
old volumes being ranged about on the shelves.</p>

<p>“Do you want a boy?” asked Tom, of the
proprietor.</p>

<p>“Why? Did you see a sign out in front?” inquired
the man.</p>

<p>“A sign? No. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes the boys of the neighborhood
hang a sign out in front to annoy me. They know
I never hire a boy. They do it for a joke, and
several lads, in need of work, have been fooled
by it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s a very good joke,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” agreed the proprietor. “No,
I don’t want a boy, but I’m glad there’s no foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
sign out in front. How did you come to ask in
here?”</p>

<p>“Well, I used to be in Townsend’s store, and
as I need work, and every place seems to be one
where experience is needed, I thought I’d try a
book store.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” went on the man more kindly. “I
can’t afford to keep a helper. There’s very little
profit in second-hand books, and to hire a boy
would eat it all up. I need a boy quite often to
deliver books, but I can’t afford to hire one
regularly.”</p>

<p>“How often do you need one?”</p>

<p>“Well, about once a day. In fact I wish I had
one now to take some books to a man who lives
three miles from here. I’ll give you fifty cents
and your car fare if you’ll deliver them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” said Tom, glad of the chance to
earn a half dollar.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, and I’ll wrap them up.”</p>

<p>Tom was soon ready to start, carrying quite a
heavy bundle of books. As he passed out of the
store, in front of which were two big tables, with
bargains in second-hand books on them, he saw a
familiar figure reading a tattered volume.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Dr. Spidderkins!” greeted
Tom, as he recognized the aged physician.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that? Oh, it’s—I’ve forgotten—no—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
remember now, you’re William Henderson,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I’m Thomas Baldwin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You’re in the Emporium. I remember
now. My memory must be coming back.”</p>

<p>“I used to be there,” replied Tom, “but there
was no work for me after the holidays. I’m doing
odd jobs. Just now I’m carrying books for the
man who owns this place.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a fine job, carrying books,” commented
the old gentleman. “You are diffusing
knowledge, my young friend. A very noble calling.
Now I can only read books, I can’t carry them
about any more. I am reading a very fine book
now. It seems to be quite rare. It tells how the
ancient Greeks had the primitive idea of raising
chickens by means of hot water pipes—something
on the order of our modern incubators. It’s a
very valuable book. I don’t recollect when I have
found one more valuable, of its kind. Yes, once;
the same day I discovered a copy of Milton’s
Paradise Lost, in an old book store, I came across
one worth almost as much as this. That was—um—er—dear
me—I’m afraid I can’t recall what it
was. But I’ll recollect it shortly. I must purchase
this book before I forget it.”</p>

<p>Tom watched the old gentleman start into the
store, reading on the way the book in which he
was so interested. Then Tom saw something else.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Dr. Spidderkins’ pocketbook—an old-fashioned
wallet—was half-way out of his pocket, and likely
to drop to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Our hero sprang forward to reach the wallet
before it should fall. He grasped it, and was pulling
it from the doctor’s pocket, intending to restore
it to him, when he was startled to hear a
voice exclaim:</p>

<p>“Ah! You young rascal, I caught you in the
very act!”</p>

<p>Tom turned, with the pocketbook in his hand,
to behold Barton Sandow confronting him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“What do I mean? You’ll soon see what I
mean? Trying to steal the doctor’s wallet, eh?
I’ll have you arrested!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t trying to steal it!” declared Tom, indignantly.
“It was falling out of his pocket, and
I caught it to give it back to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s a likely story! You’re a thief; that’s
what you are!”</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s the matter?” asked the
aged physician, suddenly turning, as he became
aware that something unusual had happened.</p>

<p>“This boy from the book store has just stolen
your pocketbook!” said Mr. Sandow. “He’s got
it in his hand now.”</p>

<p>“My pocketbook! Bless my soul! So it is;
and I have a hundred dollars in it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>“I didn’t steal it!” cried Tom again. “It was
dropping out, and I caught it!”</p>

<p>“Hold him, doctor, until I get an officer!”
called Mr. Sandow, as he looked down the street,
and saw a policeman approaching. “We’ll soon
have him behind the bars!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>TOM LEARNS SOMETHING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Tom was much distressed. What he
meant to be an act calculated to benefit the old
doctor, was likely to turn to his disadvantage, for
he could not but admit that appearances were
against him. It did look, to a casual observer,
as though he had taken the pocketbook and was
about to run away with it.</p>

<p>“This boy a thief?” exclaimed Dr. Lemuel Spidderkins
as he looked at Tom. “I don’t believe it!
He’s the boy who brought me the books. He’s
an honest lad if ever I saw one.”</p>

<p>“Well, your eyesight isn’t very good,” remarked
Mr. Sandow sneeringly. “I saw him steal the
pocketbook.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s my pocketbook you’re talking about,
is it?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Certainly. What did you think we were speaking
about?” asked his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you meant one of these books.
Bless my soul, that is my pocketbook. I forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
about it for the moment, I was thinking so much
about this book.”</p>

<p>Tom did not know what to make of the aged
man. Certainly his memory was very short, for
in one breath he talked of his wallet, and the next
he forgot he had mentioned it.</p>

<p>“Better look and see if he took any of the
money out,” suggested Mr. Sandow. “The policeman
will be here in a minute.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take any money!” insisted Tom.</p>

<p>The aged physician opened the wallet and examined
it.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t a queer thing!” he exclaimed.
“I meant to put a hundred dollars in it this morning,
to buy a rare copy of Gibbon’s Rome, but I
forgot it. I haven’t a cent with me. You’ll have
to lend me some, Barton.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you didn’t give the hundred dollars
away?” remarked Mr. Spidderkins’ relative
with a sneer.</p>

<p>“No; I’m sure I left it home. I put it in back
of the first edition of Bacon’s Essays. I remember
now. My pocketbook hasn’t a cent in it, so
if any one had taken it, he wouldn’t have stolen
anything.”</p>

<p>Tom looked relieved. Still, he wanted to be
cleared of the least suspicion, and he did not know
how this was going to be brought about. Unexpectedly,
however, matters turned out right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>Quite a crowd had collected by this time, and
a policeman was edging his way through it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked several. “Anybody
killed?” was another inquiry.</p>

<p>“This boy tried to steal Dr. Spidderkins’ pocketbook,”
declared Mr. Sandow.</p>

<p>“I did not!” indignantly denied Tom, and he
explained what had really happened.</p>

<p>“I believe the boy’s right,” declared a middle-aged
man in the throng.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it?” asked Mr. Sandow
roughly.</p>

<p>“I was walking right behind this old gentleman,”
was the reply, and the man indicated the
physician. “I saw his pocketbook partly out of
his pocket, and I was just going to tell him to look
out for it, when he turned into the book store.
Then I thought if it fell out he would hear it drop,
and pick it up, and I passed on. When I saw the
crowd collecting I turned back.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I told you this boy was not a thief!” exclaimed
Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“You don’t know whether he is or not,” muttered
Barton Sandow.</p>

<p>“Do you want to make a charge?” asked the
policeman, turning to the aged physician.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not, officer. I know this boy to
be honest. He used to bring me books from Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Townsend’s store, and I am a good judge of
character.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the bluecoat. “You’re the
person most interested, and you ought to know
what you want to do. Now then, move on, you
people,” he said to the crowd which was growing
larger. “It’s all over. No arrest is going to
be made.”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you, sir,” said Tom to
the man who had testified in his favor. “And to
you, Dr. Spidderkins, for believing in me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” answered the middle-aged
man. “I’m glad I could do you a good turn.”</p>

<p>The crowd began to disperse, and Mr. Sandow,
with a spiteful look at Tom, hurried off up the
street.</p>

<p>“He acts as though he had a grudge against
me,” thought Tom. “I wonder why?”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Dr. Spidderkins, “my
brother-in-law has gone off, without giving me a
cent of money, and I want to buy this book. What
shall I do? Oh, my memory is getting something
very bad! I shall have to get a secretary.”</p>

<p>“I’d lend the money to you, only I haven’t any,”
said Tom. “I’m to get fifty cents for delivering
this bundle, but I won’t have that until I return.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the will for the deed,” replied the old
doctor, with a twinkle in his eyes. “Perhaps the
bookseller will trust me, or hold the book for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>The proprietor of the store, who had been in
the rear, and had not noticed the commotion in
front of his place, now came out as he saw a possible
customer. He at once recognized Dr. Spidderkins,
who was a well-known character in the
book stores of the entire city. The man at once
agreed to let the physician take the book home,
and pay for it when he liked. He even loaned
him some money for car fare, since the first five
cents he had paid a conductor, on leaving home,
had been all the cash available.</p>

<p>Now that everything was satisfactorily adjusted
Tom hurried off with the books. He delivered
them safely, received his money, and arranged to
call the following day, to see if there were any
errands he might do. As he was starting toward
home, for it was so late that he did not believe it
worth while to look any farther for work that day,
he was hailed by Charley Grove.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom,” called his chum. “I thought you
were comin’ over and see a fellow.”</p>

<p>“I meant to, some evening, Charley, but I had
to work late around Christmas time, and since then
I’ve been looking for a place, and I haven’t had
much time.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter; did you get discharged?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but there was no more work for
me after the holidays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>“I see,” declared Charley shortly. “Why don’t
you learn to be a telephone boy?”</p>

<p>“Wish I might; but where could I? Every
place I go they want experienced help, but how’s a
fellow ever to get any experience if he never has
a chance to learn?”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Maybe I could teach you something
about it. Our office closes early, and there’d be
plenty of chances to learn.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would.”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to the boss about it to-morrow, and
let you know. I stand in pretty good with him.”</p>

<p>The next evening Charley left word at Tom’s
house (for our hero was absent, delivering some
books for the second-hand dealer) that the broker
had consented to allow Tom to learn how to
operate a small private exchange switchboard.</p>

<p>When Tom got home, later that evening, he
went over to Charley’s house, and they completed
the arrangements. The following afternoon Tom
presented himself at the broker’s office. Business
was over for the day, and save for two bookkeepers
and Charley, the place was deserted.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Charley initiated Tom into the
mysteries of the plugs, the weighted cords, the
switches, cams and the push buttons that constitute
a private exchange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>“Do you think it will take me long to learn it?”
asked Tom, as he made imaginary connections.</p>

<p>“No. A week or so, and then you can get a
good job. I learned in a week. Wait now, and
we’ll practice. I’ll make believe I’m the boss.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>GETTING A PLACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span> went into one of the inner offices,
where there was a telephone connected with the
switchboard.</p>

<p>“Now when you see that little black thing drop,”
he called to Tom, “you want to take up one of
these plugs, which are attached to wires, though
they call ’em cords, and plug it into the hole under
where the black thing drops.”</p>

<p>“What’s that black thing?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s the visual signal. There’s a buzzer that
goes with it, but I cut the buzzer out, because it
makes my head ache,” answered Charley, who was
rather free and easy in his manners and talk.
“Then,” he went on, “you want to take off the
receiver, ’cause there ain’t no head and ear piece
here, and listen to get the number. When I tell
you a number you want to repeat it to central.
And say, don’t let them central girls bluff you.
Some of ’em are too tart. Think you understand
now? If you do I’ll try you out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>“Go ahead,” answered Tom, and Charley closed
the door.</p>

<p>Presently the “little black thing” dropped.
Tom pulled up a plug and inserted it into the
proper hole.</p>

<p>“Get me one-eight-two-seven, Oxford,” called
Charley over the wire. Tom repeated the number
to the central girl.</p>

<p>In a moment he heard the girl’s voice over the
wire:</p>

<p>“One-eight-two-seven, Oxford, doesn’t answer.”</p>

<p>“Aw, what ye givin’ us!” exclaimed Charley,
“cutting” into the conversation. “Ring ’em again,
Flossie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you the manager,” came the girl’s
voice over the wire again, and there was a frigid
tone in it.</p>

<p>“Say, she must be a new one on this circuit,”
remarked Charley to Tom through the instrument.
“The regular girl don’t care if you have a little
joke with her. Guess I’d better go slow. Listen
now.”</p>

<p>Soon a man’s voice was heard asking what was
wanted, and Charley, talking back to him said
he was sure there must be some one in at the number
he called.</p>

<p>“The operator will try again for you,” said the
manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>Soon Tom heard a voice he recognized as that
of a boy asking:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? What ye ringin’ that way
fer?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Pete!” called Charley. “That you?”</p>

<p>“Sure. This you, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Say, ain’t you stayin’ kinder late?”</p>

<p>“Yep. The boss went off, an’ left me a lot of
letters to copy. What you doin’ in your office?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m teachin’ a friend of mine how to run
the switchboard. Let me introduce you to him.
Hey, Tom Baldwin, that’s my friend, Pete Lansing,
on the other end of the wire.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you,” answered Tom, thinking
this was a novel form of introduction.</p>

<p>“Same to you. Keep the change!” exclaimed
Pete with a laugh. He seemed to be the same
jolly sort of a lad Charley was. “Call me up
again. I’ve got to get these letters done to put
in the mail,” he added.</p>

<p>“So long!” called Charley.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” supplemented Tom, and then a click
in the receiver told that Pete had disconnected.</p>

<p>“See how it’s done?” asked Charley, coming
from the inner room.</p>

<p>“A little,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Now it’s different when some one calls up,
and wants a member of the firm,” went on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
mentor. “If central would only ring up I’d
show——”</p>

<p>Just then one of the black signals fell.</p>

<p>“Here comes a call now,” said Charley. “It’s
just in time. Here, you take up a plug from right
under the drop, and you jab it in the hole. Then
you throw this little cam or handle down, and you
ask ’em who they want. Go ahead now.”</p>

<p>Tom listened, and heard a distant voice asking
if this was the brokerage firm in whose office the
boys were.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Simpson in?” the voice asked.</p>

<p>“He wants Mr. Simpson,” whispered Tom to
Charley.</p>

<p>“Tell him he’s gone for the day,” was the telephone
boy’s answer. “Ask him if he wants to
leave any message. If he does I’d better take it.”</p>

<p>Tom did as he was told, but the man on the
other end of the wire said he would call up in the
morning.</p>

<p>“Pull out the plug,” directed Charley, when the
drop fell once more. “He’s done. Now, if he
had wanted one of the partners, all you’d have to
do would be to take up the other cord, plug it into
the hole connected with the particular ’phone on
that’s wanted, and punch the button opposite the
hole. That rings a bell in whatever office is
wanted. See how easy it is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>“I don’t think it’s very easy,” remarked Tom,
“but maybe I’ll learn it after a while.”</p>

<p>“Of course you will. Come on, now, we’ll practice
some more.”</p>

<p>Which the two boys did, for an hour longer,
Charley giving Tom actual practice calling up
newspaper offices to ask about certain events.</p>

<p>“The newspaper fellows are all right,” declared
Charley. “They’ll tell you anything they can, and
never kick, ’cause they know people are liable to
give ’em tips on stories. And you want to be
awful polite to customers that call up, ’cause they
might report you if you wasn’t. But don’t let them
central girls jolly you. Sometimes they’ll keep you
waiting five minutes for a number. Just tell ’em
what you want, an’ say you want it quick.”</p>

<p>“I guess I could get along,” answered Tom, “if
I only had a place to get along in. I mean a job
like yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll git it in time,” declared Charley
confidently.</p>

<p>As it was getting close toward six o’clock, when
the office building in which Charley worked was
to be closed for the night, the boys left, Tom
arranging to come as often as he could to take lessons
on how to manipulate a switchboard.</p>

<p>During the next two weeks he had frequent
occasion to take advantage of Charley’s tutoring,
for, search as he did, Tom could find no permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
position. He had several places for a day or
so at a time, and managed to earn a little money
running errands for the second-hand book dealer,
but he did not make much more than his expenses.</p>

<p>Had it not been that Mrs. Baldwin and her
sister had plenty of sewing to do, the little family
would have been sorely pressed for money.</p>

<p>“It’s discouraging; isn’t it, Tom?” said his
mother one night, when he had come home from
a hard day tramping about.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m getting sort of hardened to it,” was
his plucky answer. “Maybe I’ll get a job to-morrow,
mother.”</p>

<p>He had said that every night for the past two
weeks.</p>

<p>But the next day something happened. While
Tom was at his breakfast the door bell rang, and,
answering it, the while wondering who the early
caller could be, Tom saw Charley Grove.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom,” greeted his chum. “Had your
breakfast? Come on, hurry up.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? A fire?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a chance to get you a job.”</p>

<p>“A job? Where?”</p>

<p>“In a lawyer’s office. I’ve been keeping watch
of the ads. in the paper, and this mornin’ there’s
one in for a boy in the same building where I am.
A big firm of lawyers want a boy to manage their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
private telephone exchange. Hurry up down and
get it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they want some one who is more experienced
than I am.”</p>

<p>“What? With me t’ recommend you?” asked
Charley incredulously. “Aw, come on. Hurry
up!”</p>

<p>Filled with delightful anticipations Tom hurried.
Charley took him to the office in question,
which was on the tenth floor of a big building on
Washington Street. Early as it was there were
several boys in the corridor, waiting for the place
to open.</p>

<p>“We’re too late,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You’ve got as good a show as any of ’em.
You’ll git a chance t’ see one of the lawyers, and
when you do, jest up and tell him you was my assistant.
They know it takes a good boy to work a
board in a broker’s office.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t your assistant.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell ’em I taught you. That’ll do.”</p>

<p>Charley had to leave Tom, to go to his own
duties, and a little later, the offices of the law firm
were opened. The boys were admitted in turn,
and at last it came Tom’s chance.</p>

<p>Luckily he kept his head, and answered the
questions the lawyer asked him so intelligently, and
told so frankly just what had been his telephone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
exchange experience, that the lawyer remarked
encouragingly:</p>

<p>“I believe you’ll do.”</p>

<p>Tom’s heart gave a bound. Fortunately he had
several good letters of recommendation, and,
after a few more details had been settled, our hero
found himself engaged to take charge of the
switchboard in the private exchange of the big law
firm, the boy who had previously managed it having
been discharged for incompetency.</p>

<p>“Won’t mother be glad!” exclaimed Tom, and
he wished he could hurry home and tell her, but
as the firm needed an operator at once, Tom had
to start right in. At last he had what he felt was
a good position.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>TOM MAKES A DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> if our hero imagined that working a telephone
switchboard in the office of a big law firm
was going to be as easy as it was to practice with
his chum, Tom was grievously disappointed. Soon
after he took his seat in front of the board, with
its maze of cords, plugs, holes, cams and push
buttons, he had a call for one of the partners.
There were three members of the firm, which was
known officially as Boise, Keen &amp; Cutler. Mr.
Boise was the senior member and Elias Cutler the
junior.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Keen, a pleasant middle-aged man,
who had hired Tom, and he showed the boy how
to make the connections to the telephones in the
offices of various members of the firm. There
were also three clerks, each one of whom had an
instrument.</p>

<p>At first, as it was early morning, only a few
calls came in, and these Tom easily managed.
The lawyers only had occasion to call up outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
parties once or twice, and Tom had no difficulty
in getting the desired numbers. But, as the day
advanced, and more business began to come in on
the wire, the boy soon found he had his hands
full.</p>

<p>“I guess it isn’t going to be as easy as I
thought,” he said to himself, as he placed plug
after plug in the holes, and worked the cams and
buttons as fast as he could.</p>

<p>About noon some one called for Mr. Boise, and
Tom put the plug of the cord in the hole he
thought connected with the instrument on the desk
of the head of the firm. Then a call came for Mr.
Keen, but, while Tom was making that connection
the door of Mr. Cutler’s office opened, and that
individual fairly rushed out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” he asked Tom,
rather savagely. “Don’t you know enough to
operate a switchboard?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—what’s wrong?” asked Tom innocently.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve put the party who wanted Mr.
Boise on my wire, and you spoilt a long distance
call I had to Taunton. Now I’ve got to call up
again, and maybe I’ll lose my party. Why don’t
you make the right connections?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought I did, Mr. Cutler.”</p>

<p>“Well, thinking so isn’t going to mend matters.
Now give the party that’s on my wire to Mr. Boise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
and then see if you can get central for me. I never
saw such a poor operator,” he murmured, as he
went back into his office and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Boise came out of his office then. He had
evidently heard what the junior partner said.</p>

<p>“Try and be a little more careful, Tom,” he remarked
kindly. “I know you are new at it, and
you’ll get along all right after a while. Don’t be
afraid to ask questions. It’s better to be sure than
sorry, you know. That’s an old adage, but it’s a
good one. Have you changed the party to my
wire?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Tom, grateful for the kind
manner in which the head of the firm spoke.</p>

<p>Tom could not help being a little nervous, but
he kept a good grip on himself, shut his teeth
firmly together and resolved to make no more mistakes
that day. He was glad when the noon hour
came, as he could go out and get something to eat,
and, while he was gone, one of the junior clerks
operated the switchboard. Tom went to a little
restaurant where Charley Grove had promised to
meet him.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked his chum, “how’d you make
out?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, I guess. I made a couple of
blunders, and Mr. Cutler, the junior partner,
scolded me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>“Aw, don’t mind that. Tell him it was the central
girl’s fault.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Aw, how do they know? I always blame the
girls. They’re used to it, and, besides, the bosses
never see ’em, so it don’t make no difference.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d like to do that. I’ll catch
on to it after a while.”</p>

<p>“Sure you will. What are you goin’ to eat?”</p>

<p>Then the boys began to discuss the bill of fare,
and were soon enjoying their lunch as only hungry
boys can.</p>

<p>“What time do you get through?” asked
Charley.</p>

<p>“Five o’clock, Mr. Boise said.”</p>

<p>“How much wages do you get?”</p>

<p>“Nine dollars a week, and I’m to get ten after
I’ve been there a while.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty good, for a start. I’m going to
strike the boss for another dollar soon. I’m worth
more than ten a week to ’em. Why, there’s thousands
of dollars of business goes over my ’phone
every hour, and I ought to get more than ten.”</p>

<p>“I hope you do,” said Tom cordially. “But say,
Charley, I wish you’d do me a favor.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Want any money? I ain’t got
much, ’cause I went to the theatre twice this week.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t money. I have enough for a few
days yet, until I get paid. But I wish you’d stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
at my house, on your way home, and tell my
mother I have a good place. She’ll be anxious to
know, and I have no way to send her word.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll do it. But ain’t there some place
near there you can call up on the wire, and ask
’em to take the message to her? I do that sometimes,
when I’m comin’ home late.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know of any place but the drug
store, and they might charge for sending a message.
Besides, maybe the firm wouldn’t like me to
use the telephone for my private affairs.”</p>

<p>“Aw, it don’t make any difference to them.
They pay for the wire by the year, and you can use
it as often as you like. But I’ll stop and tell your
mother. I quit at three o’clock. There’s no
brokerage business done after that.”</p>

<p>Tom went back to the switchboard, glad to
think his mother would know of his success sooner
than he hoped to be able to inform her. During
the afternoon he acquired more confidence in himself,
and, though once or twice he gave central the
wrong numbers, from imperfectly catching them as
they were repeated by the members of the firm,
Mr. Boise and Mr. Keen did not get angry over
the errors. Tom was congratulating himself that
he was going to get through the day without further
offending Mr. Cutler, when that individual
called for a certain number.</p>

<p>Tom gave it to central, and, having made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
connections threw up the cam, in order not to listen
to what was being said. Then he leaned back in
his chair, for he was tired, and the receiver of the
telephone, which was fastened to his head by a
spring clip, that held it in place so he could use
both hands, made his ear ache. He wished he
could take it off.</p>

<p>One of the black signal disks dropped, and Tom,
depressing the cam, to ask what was wanted, heard
Mr. Cutler speaking to him.</p>

<p>“There you go again!” exclaimed the irate
lawyer. “You have given me the wrong number.
I called for one-six-four-three, Chelsea, and you
have given me one-four-six-three. That’s a police
station. What do I want of a police station?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” murmured Tom. “I’ll get the
right number for you.”</p>

<p>“That was my mistake,” came another voice
over the wire—the central girl’s voice. “I beg
your pardon,” she added.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Tom pleasantly. He
wished Mr. Cutler could have heard the explanation,
but the lawyer, in disgust, had hung up his
receiver until Tom should get him the right connection.</p>

<p>“I thought I didn’t give the wrong number,”
mused the boy. “I hope I don’t do anything more
to annoy Mr. Cutler. He seems to get angry very
easily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>Tom was glad when it was time to go home, and
he found his mother and aunt ready to welcome
him, for Charley had told them the good news.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad!” exclaimed Mrs. Baldwin.
“This is the best place you’ve had yet.”</p>

<p>“And so refined,” added Miss Ramsey. “I
always wanted a lawyer in the family, and now
Tom has a chance to be one.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will be a good many years before
I can learn law over the switchboard, Aunt
Sallie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will have opportunities. I think
it is better to be a lawyer than a bookseller.”</p>

<p>“Especially as I haven’t any chance to become
a bookseller,” added Tom with a laugh. “Well,
mother, is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom; I have just finished some sewing
for Mrs. Crawford Leeth. I wish you would take
it home, when I have made out the bill. I think
she will pay you, for she owes me for some other
work, and she promised to settle for it all when I
sent this waist home. So please ask her, if she
doesn’t offer to give you the money.”</p>

<p>“I will, mother. I suppose I’d better not sit
on this, in case the car is crowded,” he added with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Mercy sakes, no!” exclaimed his aunt. “It
has some valuable lace on it. Be very careful of
it, Tom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>It was quite a long ride to where Mrs. Leeth
lived, and it was nearly eight o’clock when Tom
arrived. The house was a fine one, in an exclusive
residential section, and the door was opened
by a colored butler.</p>

<p>“Here’s the dress for Mrs. Leeth,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it,” replied the butler.</p>

<p>“But I want to see Mrs. Leeth,” insisted Tom,
who had in mind his mother’s injunction to get
the money.</p>

<p>“She am busy.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll wait,” said Tom firmly, and, holding
on to the package, which the butler offered to
take from him, he stepped into the hall, and sat
down.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her about it,” promised the colored
man, “but she hab some company, an’ I know she
won’t see you.”</p>

<p>“You might take her this,” suggested Tom,
handing the colored man the bill.</p>

<p>The butler vanished behind some hanging plush
portieres, and came back presently to say:</p>

<p>“She’ll be heah immejeet, but she doan’t laik
to be ’sturbed when she hab company. She am
very indignant.”</p>

<p>“She is, eh?” thought Tom. “So would my
mother be if I didn’t come back with the money.”</p>

<p>Presently there was a swish of silken skirts, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
a handsomely-dressed woman came into the reception
hall where Tom sat.</p>

<p>“Have you brought my dress, boy?” she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” answered Tom, rising.</p>

<p>“You are more than two hours late with it. I
wanted it to wear this evening, and I am much
disappointed.”</p>

<p>“I brought it as soon as it was finished. I think
there was more work on it than my mother
thought.”</p>

<p>“She should learn to calculate better then, and
not disappoint her customers. You may lay it on
the table there, and tell her I am displeased that
it is late.”</p>

<p>“She asked me to bring back the money for it,”
said Tom boldly, determined not to be awed by
the airs of this society matron. “I gave the butler
the bill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have it; but it is not convenient for me
to pay it now.”</p>

<p>“My mother particularly wished it, Mrs.
Leeth.”</p>

<p>“Probably, but I have no change in the house.”</p>

<p>“I can take a check,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“My husband is at his office downtown, and he
will not be home until late. I will send your
mother a check to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“If you will allow me, I will go down to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
husband’s office,” suggested the boy. “You can
write him a note, authorizing him to give me a
check for the bill. Or you can telephone him,”
he added, seeing an instrument in the rear of the
hall.</p>

<p>The woman seemed rather annoyed at Tom’s
suggestion, but she had no good excuse ready.
Rather reluctantly, therefore, she telephoned to her
husband at his office, and told him a boy would
presently call on him with a bill, for which she
requested Mr. Leeth to make out a check.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Tom, when Mrs. Leeth had
given him the business address of her husband.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I shall have your mother do
any more work for me,” said the handsomely-dressed
woman haughtily. “She disappointed me
so this evening, by not having my waist here on
time.”</p>

<p>Tom said nothing, but he rather thought his
mother would not care to work for a customer who
was so exacting, and so careless about pay.</p>

<p>Tom was soon at the big office building where
Mr. Leeth had a suite of rooms. Though it was
nine o’clock there were lights in several of the
windows, for, it appeared, some of the tenants
were working overtime. Mr. Leeth was agent for
a big manufacturing concern.</p>

<p>Tom had to climb several flights of stairs to
Mr. Leeth’s office. He found that gentleman in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and soon had received a check, which he knew
would please his mother.</p>

<p>“Just receipt the bill,” requested Mr. Leeth.</p>

<p>While Tom was signing his name to the receipt
for the money, the office door opened, and some
one came in. The boy did not look up to see who
it was, but he heard Mr. Leeth exclaim:</p>

<p>“Ah, come right in. I’ve been waiting for you.
Did you bring the papers and the cash?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I had a hard time getting the money.
The old doctor is getting rather suspicious of late.
I trusted his faulty memory——”</p>

<p>The speaker paused suddenly, evidently in response
to a warning gesture from Mr. Leeth, for
the newcomer had not observed Tom, who was
standing at a desk behind the door.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said our hero, as he folded
up the check, put it in his pocket, and prepared
to leave. As he turned he came face to face with
Barton Sandow.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say who was the more surprised,
the man or Tom. Mr. Sandow started,
and seemed about to say something.</p>

<p>“Ah, are you acquainted?” asked Mr. Leeth in
surprise.</p>

<p>“I have met Mr. Sandow,” replied Tom, while
Dr. Spidderkins’ brother-in-law murmured something
unintelligible. Then, as the man who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
called Tom a gutter-pup did not notice him, the
boy passed out.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he’s doing in there?” our hero
thought, as he walked down the dimly-lighted corridors.
“And he must have been referring to Dr.
Spidderkins, when he spoke of the money and
papers. I wonder if the old doctor is safe with
those two?” he went on, as he thought of the queer
actions of Mr. and Mrs. Sandow, and how incapable
the aged physician, with his failing
memory, was of looking out for his own interests.</p>

<p>Though he did not know it then, Tom had made
quite a discovery that night.</p>

<small>SEEKING INFORMATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> he was very busy the next day, Tom
could not help thinking, several times, of the scene
he had witnessed the night before, when he received
the check.</p>

<p>“I wish I had listened more closely to what
Sandow said,” he mused. “If I had known it was
he, I would have done so. Let me see, it was
something about bringing the money and the
papers, and that he had a hard time getting the
money because the old doctor was getting suspicious.
Then he said something about trusting to
his faulty memory, and that was all.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he must have referred to Dr. Spidderkins.
I don’t like the look of that Sandow,
and his wife isn’t much better. From what I’ve
seen they have the old gentleman right under their
thumb, and I guess they could almost make him
believe black was white, because he can’t remember
five minutes at a time, unless it has to do with
some book. I wish I knew whether they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
doing anything to make trouble for him. Maybe
I’d better speak to some one about it.”</p>

<p>But, the more Tom thought of it, the less he
liked to mention it to any member of the firm for
whom he worked. He had not been there long
enough to venture on any confidences, and he
realized that the lawyers were too busy to pay attention
to any matters that did not directly concern
them.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll ask a few questions of Charley
Grove,” he concluded. “I’ll see him this noon at
the restaurant.”</p>

<p>Tom made no mistakes that morning, and was
in better spirits when he went out for his noonday
meal. He found his chum waiting for him,
and, when he had a chance, spoke of his trip the
night previous, to get the check.</p>

<p>“That woman thought she was going to put me
off,” said Tom, “but I guess I surprised her, when
I offered to go for the cash. I met Barton Sandow
in Mr. Leeth’s office,” he added, as though it was
of no importance.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that fellow,” replied Charley.
“He was in our office to-day, buying some stocks,
and he called me down because I didn’t get his
number quick enough for him. I didn’t dare say
anything, ’cause the boss was standing right there,
but I took my own time making the connection
for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>“Who did he call up?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Why, that fellow you were telling me about—Mr.
Leeth. But I couldn’t hear what he said, as
I had to take care of a lot of calls from customers
then. We have five trunk lines on our switchboard.
How many have you?”</p>

<p>“Only three. Say, do you suppose there’s any
truth in what you told me, about Sandow wanting
to get hold of Dr. Spidderkins’ money?”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” answered Charley easily.
“You could take most anything you wanted away
from Doc. Spidderkins now, and he wouldn’t know
it, if you gave him a book to look at. He’s daffy
on books, every one says.”</p>

<p>“But he’s a very fine old gentleman.”</p>

<p>“You bet he is. Better that Barton Sandow.
I wish I had a chance to call Sandow down, for
being so fresh with me,” added Charley, for the
matter of the telephone call seemed to rankle in
his mind.</p>

<p>“He called me a mean name, once,” said Tom,
telling of the day when he had gone into Sandow’s
office, to look for work.</p>

<p>That afternoon, just before closing time, Mr.
Boise, the head of the law firm, came out to the
switchboard.</p>

<p>“How are you getting on?” he asked Tom,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>“That’s good. I think you’ll learn to be quite
expert in time. I want you to do a little errand
for me on your way home,” he added, and Tom
saw that he had a bundle of papers in his hand.
“Do you know where Dr. Spidderkins lives?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” replied Tom, wondering what was
coming.</p>

<p>“That’s good. Then you’re acquainted in the
Back Bay section?”</p>

<p>“Not very well, but I carried books to the doctor’s
house several times, when I worked for Mr.
Townsend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I had forgotten about that. Well,
I wish you would take these papers to him, and tell
him that I have attended to all his requests. The
land matters are all in good shape now, and the
estate books are all balanced. Can you remember
that, or shall I write a note?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can remember it. Are you his lawyers?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we do considerable business for him.”</p>

<p>“A chum of mine—Charley Grove, whom Dr.
Spidderkins used to attend—says the doctor is
quite rich,” went on Tom, thinking this a good
chance to get some more information.</p>

<p>“Yes; he is quite wealthy,” said Mr. Boise.
“His estate is a large one. Most of it came to
him through his father, and his brother left him
some when he died. That, together with the doctor’s
own property, makes him very well-to-do.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
But he is so forgetful that we have to make
memoranda of everything for him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had some experience with his short
memory,” remarked Tom, smiling at the recollection.</p>

<p>“Now don’t forget to impress the message on
him,” cautioned Mr. Boise, “and watch where he
puts the papers you give him. Just as likely as
not he’ll call on me some day, and say he never
received them.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Tom, and, when it came time
for him to lay aside the telephone head-piece, he
did so with a feeling of relief, for he welcomed
the long trolley ride to the Back Bay district, even
though it would bring him home rather late.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sandow opened the door when our hero
arrived at the Spidderkins’ mansion.</p>

<p>“Here are some papers for Dr. Spidderkins,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll give ’em to him, then you won’t have to
come in and get mud all over my clean floors,”
she said, scowling at Tom.</p>

<p>“But I have a particular message to give the
doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, then you can come in, I suppose,”
but Mrs. Sandow did not speak very graciously.</p>

<p>“Ah, glad to see you,” greeted the aged physician,
who, for a wonder, did not forget Tom this
time. “When are you going to bring me my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
books? I ordered some of Mr. Townsend to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m not there any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s so. I forgot. Let’s see, you told
me where you were employed, but my wretched
memory has made me forget it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I told you,” replied Tom, “but
I’m with Boise, Keen &amp; Cutler. I have brought
you some papers from them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I told them to send up the documents,
but I had forgotten all about it. I have
secured quite a rare book, an early edition of
Smollett, and that drove everything else out of my
mind. But come into my study.”</p>

<p>He led the way into a room, the walls of which
were lined with row after row of books. Tom
gave him the papers and delivered the message,
then, in obedience with the instructions of Mr.
Boise, the lad watched to see where Dr. Spidderkins
would put the documents.</p>

<p>“I’ll lay them on this shelf,” the doctor said,
“right under this volume of Fielding. Ah, that
is a rare and valuable work. Then I’ll remember
where the papers are. I picked up that book on
Fielding the same day I got the first edition of
Plutarch’s Lives—no, I’m wrong—it was the day
I secured, in a second-hand book store, the complete
edition of Dickens, with the original illustrations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Queer, how some things will slip out of
my mind.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you’ll remember where the
papers are now, doctor?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed I will. I have occasion to look
at the volume of Balzac every day, and——”</p>

<p>“But I thought you said you was going to put
them under a book on baseball fielding.”</p>

<p>“Baseball fielding! Oh! Ha! Ha! I see.
You thought I was going in for sport! No, no,
my dear young friend; Fielding is the name of an
early English novelist. But I did say Fielding,
and not Balzac. There! My memory is getting
more and more wretched every day!”</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t know much about books,” admitted
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll learn. I’m much obliged to you,
for bringing the papers. There, I’ve put them
under Mr. Fielding’s book—not the baseball fielding,
remember, Tom—and they’ll be safe until I
want them, and I shan’t forget where they are.”</p>

<p>“If you do I’ll try and help you remember,”
said the boy with a laugh.</p>

<p>Tom bade the doctor good-night, and started
out of the door. As he opened the portal, and
stepped into the faintly-lighted hall, he thought he
heard the rustle of a woman’s dress, and he was
almost sure he saw a figure hastily disappearing
around the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>“That must have been Mrs. Sandow,” thought
Tom, “and I believe she was listening at the doctor’s
door. There’s something queer going on in
this house, and I wish I knew what it was.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a slight accident on the trolley line
that night, when Tom was going home. A truck
got stalled on the track, and it was nearly midnight
when he got to the house, where he found
his mother anxiously waiting for him.</p>

<p>“You poor boy!” she exclaimed. “Where have
you been? Did you have your supper?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. When I found the trolleys were
blocked I got out of the car, which happened to
be near a small restaurant, and I had a nice little
meal. I had to go to Dr. Spidderkins’ house for
Mr. Boise.”</p>

<p>“I think you have a good deal of night work to
do, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m the youngest member of the firm,”
replied her son jokingly. “I’ve got to do the hard
work until I rise in my profession.”</p>

<p>Tom fell asleep vainly wondering whether or
not he had better mention to Mr. Boise the suspicions
he had concerning Barton Sandow and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
wife. But, in the morning, he decided he had
better not interfere with what did not concern
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait until I have some better proof, before
I say anything,” he thought. “Maybe I’m
making a mountain out of a mole-hill.”</p>

<p>For a week or more events went along smoothly
at the law office where Tom was employed. He
was getting to be quite expert at the switchboard,
and seldom made a mistake.</p>

<p>Try as he did, however, he could not seem to
please Mr. Cutler. That lawyer was continually
finding fault, even when Tom got for him the required
connections in almost record-breaking time.</p>

<p>“You’re worse than the other boy we had!” exclaimed
the junior member one day, when Tom
had cut him off a second or two before he was
through. Then Mr. Cutler strode into the room
occupied by Mr. Boise. As he left the door partly
open Tom could not help hearing part of what
was said.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you discharge that boy and hire
a good one?” asked the junior partner, wrathfully.</p>

<p>“What boy?” asked Mr. Boise, who had a
habit of becoming so deeply immersed in thinking
of a case, that often questions had to be repeated
several times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>“That telephone boy—Tom Baldwin. He’s
more bother than he’s worth.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought he was doing good work. I
have no trouble getting my connections. What
seems to be the difficulty?”</p>

<p>“Well—er—I don’t know exactly—but he
doesn’t seem to be up to the mark. I think we
ought to have another boy.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I can’t agree with you, Mr. Cutler,”
Tom heard Mr. Boise say. “Mr. Keen engaged
Tom, and he spoke well of his qualifications.
The boy has a mother and an aged aunt partly dependent
on him, and he was out of work for some
time before coming to us. He learned how to
work a switchboard, hoping to get a place, and
now he has one I don’t feel we should discharge
him—especially when there is no good cause for
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only mentioned it,” said Mr. Cutler,
rather weakly. “Perhaps he’ll do all right, but
he makes mistakes.”</p>

<p>“So we all do,” remarked Mr. Boise. “I think
Tom will be all right.”</p>

<p>Then the door was closed, and Tom could hear
no more. But what he had heard told him two
things, one of which he knew before. He was
made aware that Mr. Boise was very friendly to
him, and he realized that Mr. Cutler had some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
grudge against him, though what it could be our
hero could not imagine.</p>

<p>“It can’t be about the telephone calls,” reasoned
the lad, “for I haven’t made but one error on his
wire in nearly a week, and that was a small one—cutting
him off. He was through, anyhow, for
the party on the other end of the wire had said
‘good-by.’ But I’m glad Mr. Boise stuck up for
me.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, toward the close of the day’s
business, as Tom was sitting in front of the switchboard,
idly wondering where the next call would
come from, one of the black drops fell. He
plugged in a wire, and asked:</p>

<p>“Whom did you wish to speak to?”</p>

<p>Back came the answer, in a voice that startled
Tom, for he knew he had heard it somewhere
before:</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Cutler in?”</p>

<p>“I’ll connect you with him. Hold the wire,”
directed Tom, and he made doubly sure that he
put the right plug in the right hole, so that the
person could speak to the junior partner.</p>

<p>As soon as this connection was made there came
another call, for Mr. Boise. The head of the firm
was soon conversing with a client, and then a third
drop fell.</p>

<p>“Well, the day is going to wind up with a rush,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
thought Tom. “Whom did you wish?” he asked
politely.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to Mr. Cutler,” spoke a woman’s
voice.</p>

<p>“He is busy now. If you will hold the wire,
I’ll let you speak to him as soon as he has finished.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Don’t forget it. It’s very important.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not. Just hold the wire.”</p>

<p>Then, as was his custom, when a party was waiting
for one of the law-firm members who was
already engaged on the wire, Tom depressed the
cam which enabled him to hear whether Mr. Cutler
and the speaker whose voice had so startled
the boy, were finished. Tom, as he “cut in” heard
Mr. Cutler saying:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I’ll attend to it for you. The plan
ought to work, but you’ve got to be careful.”</p>

<p>Then, before he shut off the connection through
his own instrument, he heard the man on the other
end of the wire say:</p>

<p>“I’ve got the papers all right. The forgetful
old dotard left them in his study, and my wife
heard him and the boy talking about them. I’ve
got ’em all right, and he’ll never remember anything
about them. I guess they ought to be worth
something, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” Mr. Cutler replied. “The estate
is a big one, and there’s no reason why you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
I shouldn’t have a share. I guess we can work it
without any one knowing anything about it. I’ll
call you up in a few days Mr.——”</p>

<p>“No names!” cautioned the other quickly.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Mr. Cutler with a laugh.
“I understand. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Tom knew that the conversation was finished,
and that he could give the waiting lady the junior
partner on the wire. But he hesitated a moment
before pulling out the plugs, and readjusting them.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that man’s voice before,” he mused.
“I know it well. Who can it be?”</p>

<p>Then there came over the wire the voice of the
man in question. It seemed that he had forgotten
something, though Mr. Cutler was busy talking
to the lady.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello!” he called. “I say! I forgot
something. Wait a moment, Mr. Cutler!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cutler is busy on another wire,” replied
Tom. “If you wait I can get him back for you?”</p>

<p>“Who is this speaking?” asked the man’s voice,
and there seemed to be a note of fear in it.</p>

<p>“This is the private exchange operator.”</p>

<p>“I know that, but who are you? What’s your
name?”</p>

<p>“Tom Baldwin. Do you wish me to get Mr.
Cutler on the wire for you?”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p110.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“No!” came the sudden answer.<br />

<span class="illoright"><i>Page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.</i></span></p>

<p>“No!” came the sudden answer, and the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
hung up his receiver with a bang that made a loud
click in Tom’s ear.</p>

<p>Then, like a flash there came to our hero the
recognition of the voice.</p>

<p>“That was Barton Sandow speaking!” he exclaimed
softly. “I’m pretty sure it was, and I believe
he was talking about that Spidderkins estate
and those papers I took to the doctor!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>SANDOW IS ALARMED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> hardly knew what to do. As he finished
his work that afternoon, and started toward home,
he had half a mind to go and tell Dr. Spidderkins
what he had heard. Then he reflected that
he could say nothing definite, and that, after all,
the mysterious message might be a perfectly proper
one. It might refer to some other person than the
eccentric doctor.</p>

<p>“But one thing I’m pretty certain of,” thought
Tom, “and that is the voice I heard was that of
Barton Sandow. Maybe I had better speak to Mr.
Boise about it. No, if I do that I’ll have to say
Sandow was talking to Mr. Cutler, and Mr. Boise
will consult with him. Mr. Cutler will accuse me
of listening, when I really couldn’t help it, and I’ll
lose my place.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t do that. I wish I knew some one
I might consult with. Perhaps Mr. Keen would
be a good man. He seems kind, and I could ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
him to say nothing about it to Mr. Cutler. I’ll
think that over.”</p>

<p>Which Tom did, after he got to bed that night,
but in the morning he was as unsettled as ever.</p>

<p>“I’ll not do anything until I’m more certain,”
he decided. “But if Mr. Sandow calls up Mr. Cutler
on the wire again, I’ll listen to all he says. I
think I have a right to, for I believe he is up to
something wrong.”</p>

<p>During the days that followed Tom became
more and more expert at the switchboard, so that
even Mr. Cutler, anxious as he was to do so, could
find no fault with the lad.</p>

<p>“Tom, I have some good news for you,” Mr.
Keen said to him one Saturday afternoon, when
he was paying the telephone boy his weekly wages.
“In the first place Mr. Boise wants me to tell you
that he is very well satisfied with your work.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that.”</p>

<p>“And, better than being merely glad about it,
he has shown his appreciation in a substantial way.
Hereafter your wages will be eleven dollars a
week.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, very much,” replied Tom, “and
tell Mr. Boise that I appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“I think he knows that. He is a man who likes
to help boys get along in the world, and I am sure
he will prove your friend.”</p>

<p>Tom was delighted at the additional money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
every week, and he knew his mother and aunt
would share in his joy. He was now getting more
than Charley Grove, who had been at the switchboard
over a year, for Charley had not received
the additional dollar he had “struck the boss for,”
as he expressed it.</p>

<p>Tom thought this a good opportunity, when
Mr. Keen was in such a particularly kindly mood,
to broach the subject of Barton Sandow, and the
mysterious message, but, just as he was about to
mention it, a telephone call came in, and he had
to adjust the switchboard. The call was for Mr.
Keen, who had remained after the other members
of the law firm had departed, and when he had
finished talking he hurried away, before Tom had
a chance to more than say “good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to him Monday,” thought Tom, but,
when Monday came, Mr. Keen had to go out of
town, and was away for several days.</p>

<p>There came several dull days in the law office,
when, for hours at a time Tom would sit at the
switchboard and not a call would come in. This
was rather tiresome, but he had to remain on duty,
as there was no telling when he would have to
make the connections.</p>

<p>“I wish I could read,” he thought. “Guess I’ll
ask one of the clerks if there’s any objection.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, he broached the matter to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
young fellow who relieved him at the board during
the noon hour.</p>

<p>“Sure you can read, if you want to,” said the
youth. “Why don’t you start in to read law?
This is a good chance. I used to have your job,
and one day I was reading a book of adventures.
Mr. Boise saw me, and wanted to know what it
was. I told him, and I thought he’d object, but
he suggested that I start to study law in my spare
moments. I did, beginning on a simple book, and
finally he made me a clerk. That gave me more
time, and I’ll be ready for the bar examinations in
another year.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” said Tom. “I
believe I would like to know something of law.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you a book to start on,” said the clerk
kindly, and he handed Tom a volume that did not
look very attractive. But Tom was not easily discouraged,
and he began it. He found it simpler
than he had expected, and he became quite interested
in it.</p>

<p>“What have you there?” asked Mr. Boise of
him, one afternoon, as the senior partner came in
from a late lunch. “Is it the life of ‘Fearless
Frank, the Boy Scout,’ or ‘Death-Dealing Dick’?
Oh, there’s no objection to you reading,” he added
hastily, as Tom started up in some confusion.</p>

<p>As he did so the book fell down, open, so that
the title could be read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>“Ah, the law primer,” remarked Mr. Boise. “I
am glad to see this, Tom. Not that there is anything
wrong in reading a good book of adventure,
for I like that sort of a story myself, once in a
while, but they are not good as a steady diet.
When you finish that book I will loan you
another.”</p>

<p>He passed on, nodding his head in approval.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the days passed, Tom was
wondering why Barton Sandow did not call up
again.</p>

<p>“Maybe I frightened him,” thought the telephone
boy.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Keen called Tom into his
office.</p>

<p>“I want you to leave a little earlier to-day,” he
said. “A client of ours is coming to the Parker
House. Do you know where that hotel is?”</p>

<p>Tom well knew the location of the famous hotel,
the rolls of which have become a byword in many
parts of the country.</p>

<p>“I want you to take these papers to Mr. Jonathan
Norris, who is stopping there,” went on Mr.
Keen. “Ask the clerk to show you to his room,
deliver the documents, and have him give you a
receipt. He is expecting them.”</p>

<p>“What about the telephone?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I will have one of the clerks look after it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
you, while you are gone. You need not come back,
here to-night.”</p>

<p>Tom liked that, as it would give him about an
hour off.</p>

<p>He found Mr. Norris without trouble, delivered
the papers, and was walking briskly toward the
door of the main entrance, when he nearly collided
with Barton Sandow, who was hurriedly entering
the hotel.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“What! You here!” exclaimed Sandow. “I
thought—I——”</p>

<p>He seemed quite startled, and Tom wondered
what the matter could be.</p>

<p>“Did I hurt you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Hurt me? No—but you——”</p>

<p>Again Sandow seemed confused.</p>

<p>“Was it you at the telephone switchboard the
other day?” he asked, and Tom wondered at the
friendly tone he used. It was quite different from
the voice in which Mr. Barton Sandow had called
our hero a “gutter-pup.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the boy. “You mean the day
you called up Mr. Cutler?”</p>

<p>“That’s the day. Did you hear what I said?”</p>

<p>“Part of it,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“You did?” and Sandow seemed quite excited.</p>

<p>“I could not help it. I had to come in on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
wire to see if Mr. Cutler was through, as a lady
was anxious to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it doesn’t matter,” spoke Sandow,
with an air of studied indifference. “The message
was of no importance. It was about some property
I own, and which is in litigation. Mr. Cutler
is my lawyer. It’s only a small matter.”</p>

<p>Tom wondered if it was, why Mr. Sandow
should seem so frightened over something, for
frightened the man certainly was.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you reported what you heard
to any one; did you?” asked Sandow eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Tom quickly. “It is against
orders to speak of the firm’s business outside.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, though in this case it doesn’t
make any difference. It was of small importance.
The affair is closed up now. It was of no importance
whatever.” And Sandow passed on.</p>

<p>“Well, if it wasn’t,” thought Tom, who had his
own ideas on the subject, “you’re taking a great
deal of trouble to impress that fact on me.”</p>

<p>Wondering more than ever what sort of a game
Sandow was playing, Tom left the lobby of the
hotel, and started toward home.</p>

<small>MR. CUTLER’S VISITOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Tom,” asked Mr. Keen, the next morning,
“did you deliver the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and Mr. Norris said he would call
on you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Very good; I’ll be here. Now get me the surrogate’s
office, in the court house.”</p>

<p>Tom had on a small card, the numbers of the
places most frequently called up by the members
of the firm, in order to save the time of looking in
the telephone book, and he soon had the connection
for Mr. Keen.</p>

<p>As our hero was going home that afternoon
Mr. Keen gave him a message to deliver to a
client who lived in the suburbs, across the Charles
River.</p>

<p>“It is quite important,” said the lawyer, “or I
would not ask you to spend your own time delivering
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind,” replied Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>“Well, I am sure I appreciate that. Since you
are so good-natured about it I think I will ask
you to do a little more. This concerns a suit which
is to be tried to-morrow. I must have an answer
from this gentleman, and he has no telephone.
Will you go out there, and bring back the answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Bring it here to the office,” went on Mr. Keen.
“I am going to work here quite late, to-night, and,
if I should not be in when you get here, leave the
answer on my desk, for I may be out to supper.”</p>

<p>“I think I can be back here by eight, or, at the
most, nine o’clock,” spoke Tom.</p>

<p>“That will do very nicely. I expect to be up
until nearly midnight, getting the papers in shape
for the trial to-morrow. You had better start
now, as it is quite a ride out there.”</p>

<p>With a bundle of papers in his pocket Tom
started off. He had sent word to his mother, by
telephoning to a drug store near his house, that
he would not be home until late.</p>

<p>Tom rather enjoyed the trolley ride, for it was
in a section he had seldom visited.</p>

<p>“I hope I find a restaurant out here,” he remarked
to himself as the trolley rumbled along.
“I’ll be mighty hungry by the time I get back.”</p>

<p>When he reached the house of the gentleman he
had been sent to see, he delivered the papers, and
asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>“How long do you think it will be before you
have the answer ready?”</p>

<p>“Why? Do you have to go somewhere else in
this neighborhood?” asked the client.</p>

<p>“I would like to go to a restaurant,” replied
Tom. “Is there one near here?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, but I’d be glad to have you
come in and take tea with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I wouldn’t like to trouble you.”</p>

<p>“It will be no trouble at all. I am all alone
this evening, as my wife and daughters have gone
to Symphony Hall to a concert. Come in, for it
will take me some time to look over these papers,
and prepare my answer.”</p>

<p>Tom was too hungry to be bashful, and he was
soon seated at a table bountifully spread, while a
neatly-dressed servant brought him a hot cup of
tea, which was grateful after the long cold ride.</p>

<p>The gentleman was so busily engaged with the
legal documents that he did not get a chance to
eat with Tom, who was all alone at the table, which
the boy did not regret, as his appetite was particularly
good, and he did not want to feel embarrassed
by dining with a stranger.</p>

<p>“There, I think that covers it,” said the gentleman
at length, as he handed Tom a bundle of
papers. “Tell Mr. Keen I will see him at court, in
the morning. Did you manage to make out a
meal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>“Yes, sir, and I thank you very much.”</p>

<p>It was nearly nine o’clock when Tom reached
the office of the law firm in Washington Street.
He went up to the big front doors and he did not
have to knock, as Mr. Keen had told him to do,
as the watchman was on the lookout for him.</p>

<p>“Is it cold out,” asked the old man, who had
charge of the building nights.</p>

<p>“It’s getting colder,” remarked Tom. “Feels
like snow, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that,” complained the watchman.
“It’s bad for my rheumatism. I don’t suppose that
bothers you.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Tom with a laugh, as he prepared
to climb the stairs to Mr. Keen’s office, the
elevator having stopped running.</p>

<p>He found a light burning in the outer room,
where the telephone switchboard was, but Mr.
Keen’s apartment was in darkness.</p>

<p>“He must be out,” thought Tom. “Well, I’ll
leave the papers on his desk. But there’s a light
in Mr. Cutler’s office. Maybe he’s in there.”</p>

<p>He started toward the door, but, before he
could reach it the portal opened, and Mr. Cutler
came out.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he asked Tom
sharply. “You have no right in here after office
hours.”</p>

<p>“I have been on an errand for Mr. Keen,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Tom. “He told me to leave the answer on
his desk.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he heard a noise of papers rattling
in Mr. Cutler’s room, and he knew the lawyer
must have a visitor. Mr. Cutler’s manner was
strange. He seemed much annoyed at beholding
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “leave the papers and then go
home. We don’t want the office boys around here
after hours.”</p>

<p>He turned to go back into his office, and, as
he did so, the door swung more fully open. Tom
caught a glimpse of a man, and, an instant later
he saw that Mr. Cutler’s visitor was none other
than Barton Sandow. Dr. Spidderkins’ brother-in-law
uttered an exclamation, as he caught sight
of Tom, and then the lawyer hastily closed the
door, from behind which came the murmur of
voices in eager, earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“He’ll never suspect anything,” he heard Mr.
Cutler say.</p>

<p>“Hush!” cautioned Mr. Sandow. “He’s altogether
too smart!”</p>

<p>“I hope I can prove too smart for you,” thought
Tom, as he laid the papers on Mr. Keen’s desk.
“There’s some funny business going on in this
office and I think it has to do with the doctor.
I’ll keep my eyes open.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>AN ODD CLIENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night, when Tom got to bed, he thought
so intently about what had happened, that he could
hardly sleep. He tried to outline some plan, by
which he might get at the bottom of the mystery
that seemed to be developing, but he could concoct
none that appeared satisfactory.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of one or two things,” he said to
himself. “One is that Sandow doesn’t like me,
and, I believe he’s a little bit afraid of what he
thinks I know. Another is that Mr. Cutler doesn’t
like me, but he isn’t alarmed that I know anything.
He’d have me discharged if he could. And another
thing is that Sandow and Cutler are in with
each other. And the last thing is that it has to
do with the estate of Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see what I can do. I don’t know
anything about law, and if I spoke to Mr. Boise,
Cutler might make it appear that everything was
all right, and I would only be laughed at. No,
I’ll lay low for a while yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>“Well, Tom,” said Mr. Keen the next morning,
“I see you got the papers all right. I found
them on my desk, when I came in. But you should
not have opened the envelope they were in. Some
of them might have been lost.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t open the envelope.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t? Why, I found it open on my
desk.”</p>

<p>“It was closed when I left it there.”</p>

<p>“That’s odd,” remarked Mr. Keen in a low
voice, but he did not in the least doubt Tom’s
word. “Was there any one in the office but yourself?”
he asked. “Maybe the envelope fell to the
floor off my desk, and, being quite full, burst open.
The janitor may have picked it up.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cutler was in his room, when I came back
last night,” replied Tom. “He had some one with
him. But I don’t believe the envelope could have
fallen off your desk. I placed it right in the
middle.”</p>

<p>“Strange how it could have come open then,”
went on Mr. Keen. “It looks as if the envelope
was opened, and then sealed up again, but not
securely. Well, it doesn’t matter much.”</p>

<p>But Tom could see that the lawyer was annoyed
by the incident, though the telephone boy
was glad there was no hint of suspicion against
himself.</p>

<p>At the same time, there came into Tom’s mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
a vague suspicion against Mr. Cutler. Yet, what
object would that lawyer have in opening the
envelope containing papers in a case, which, presumably,
all the partners knew about?</p>

<p>“Or could it have been Sandow?” thought Tom.
“He might have sneaked in and opened the envelope,
when Cutler left him alone for a minute.
That Sandow is a sneak, I believe. I have proof
enough of that in the way he tried to make me believe
that mysterious message I heard him give
Cutler didn’t amount to anything.”</p>

<p>But Tom had little more time for thought that
morning, as the switchboard kept him almost constantly
engaged. The firm had several important
cases to attend to, and inquiries and messages concerning
them were constantly coming in.</p>

<p>“Whew! My ear aches!” exclaimed Tom to
himself, after an hour during which he had been
engaged in putting plugs in, taking them out,
shifting cams and pressing buttons. “This sort of
life is lively enough, at times, to suit almost any
one. But I guess I’ll have a chance now to look
at my law book.”</p>

<p>For Tom still stuck to the resolution he had
made, to “read law” during his spare moments.
He was looking intently at the book, yet alert for
any telephone call that might come in, when he
became aware that a stranger had entered the
office. He looked up to see a man, evidently a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
farmer in his “Sunday” clothes, standing beside
the telephone desk.</p>

<p>“Is my case ready?” asked the man, evidently
taking it for granted that Tom was either a member
of the firm, or, at least, must keep track of all
the cases.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the boy answered politely.
“What is the name, please, and who did you
want to see?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I reckon I want to see Boise, Keen &amp;
Cutler. That’s the way all the letters is signed
that I git. Which one be you?”</p>

<p>“None of them,” answered Tom, with a smile.
“But if you tell me which member of the firm you
wish to see I’ll inquire about your case for you.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’m switched if I know. Jest as I say,
all the letters was signed with the hull three
names.”</p>

<p>“Were there any initial under the name?” inquired
Tom, for it was the practice of the firm to
sign the names of all three partners, together with
the first letter of the name of whichever particular
lawyer happened to dictate the letter.</p>

<p>“Here, look for yourself,” invited the farmer,
holding out a missive. “That’s the last one I got,
an’ it says my case was comin’ off to-day.”</p>

<p>Tom looked at the letter. It was one concerning
a lawsuit over some water-rights on a farm,
and from the fact that the letter “B” was below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the firm signature, the boy concluded that Mr.
Boise had written it.</p>

<p>“I guess you want to see the senior partner, Mr.
Boise,” said Tom. “Take a chair, Mr. Kendall,
and I’ll find out when he can see you.”</p>

<p>“How’d you know my name was Kendall?”
asked the odd client sharply. “You ain’t one of
them gold-brick swindlers, be ye? I understand
they call a man by his name as soon as they set
eyes on him.”</p>

<p>“I saw your name at the top of this letter,” replied
the boy, handing the missive back.</p>

<p>Then, when the farmer was carefully stowing
the letter away in his wallet, Tom quietly slipped
a plug into the hole connecting with the ’phone
in the room of Mr. Boise, and asked when the
lawyer could see Mr. Kendall.</p>

<p>“Send him in in five minutes,” came back the
answer.</p>

<p>By this time the farmer had buttoned his coat
over his pocketbook, and he looked up at Tom.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, when ye goin’ to do it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p>“Ye said ye’d find out when the head lawyer
would see me.”</p>

<p>“So I did. He’ll see you in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Look a-here, young man!” exclaimed Mr. Kendall.
“Don’t try none of them tricks. I’m sharp,
even if I do come from the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>“What tricks?” asked Tom innocently, for he
was not aware that he had done anything out of
the ordinary.</p>

<p>“Why, you said you’d go see when the lawyer
would see me. Now you say he’ll see me in five
minutes. You may be one of them new-fangled
mind-readers I’ve heard tell about, but I don’t believe
it. I don’t take no stock in it. Now you
go find out when the lawyer will see me. My
time’s valuable, for I’ve got a lot of work to do,
out at the farm.”</p>

<p>“I did find out, Mr. Kendall. Mr. Boise will
see you in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Hold on thar!” exclaimed the farmer. “You
can’t fool me. I’ve watched you every minute,
an’ you ain’t left your chair sence I come in. All
you’ve been doin’ is play with them there cords.
Now you git right up an’ find out when Mr. Boise
will see me! I ain’t so green as I look.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” exclaimed Tom, comprehending.
“You see, I telephoned to him.”</p>

<p>“Telephoned to him? You can’t fool me that
way. I know what a telephone is. We’ve got
’em out our way, an’ a bell rings when you telephone.
Besides, there ain’t no telephone here, and
who ever heard of telephonin’ from one room to
another?”</p>

<p>“But you see this is a private exchange switchboard,”
explained Tom, and he told how it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
possible to speak to a lawyer in the next room,
without leaving his seat. He made it quite clear to
the farmer.</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand,” said Mr. Kendall. “I’m
sorry I made such a fuss about it, ’specially when
you ain’t well. Did you see a doctor about it?”</p>

<p>“About what?” asked the boy, wondering what
new notion the farmer had.</p>

<p>“About your ear ache. I see you have to wear
some instrument on yer head. I had a nephew
once that had ear ache dreadful bad. We done
everything for him, blew smoke into it, put bags
of hot pepper in, but it didn’t do no good. Then
I poured some hot sweet oil in, and that worked
fine. Ever try it?”</p>

<p>“But I have no ear ache.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t? Then what ye got that contraption
on yer head for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the telephone receiver. I have it
clamped over my ear so I will have both hands
free to use on the plugs.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” remarked Mr. Kendall. “I wondered
what in the world it was for. Suthin’ like blinders
on a hoss.”</p>

<p>Just then one of the drops fell, and Tom, inserting
a plug, heard Mr. Boise speaking to him.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Mr. Kendall now,” he said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Boise will attend to your case now,” repeated
Tom to the farmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>“Wa’al, I’ll be switched, ef that ain’t quite an
invention,” exclaimed the farmer, as he arose to
go into the inner office. “I never heard of telephonin’
to a man twenty feet from ye. Next thing
they’ll be havin’ flyin’ machines t’ go from one
room t’ another.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A MEAN PLOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> farmer chuckled at his joke, as he passed
into the apartments of Mr. Boise, whence, presently,
his voice could be heard discussing his case.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care for many clients like him,”
thought Tom, “though he meant well enough. I’d
have to explain too much to them.”</p>

<p>He resumed his perusal of the law book, until
a drop of one of the black disks told him some one
from outside wished to talk to a member of the
firm. The call was for Mr. Cutler, and, when he
had made the connection Tom threw up the cam,
so that he could not hear what was being said.</p>

<p>For, several times of late, the junior partner
had accused the telephone boy of listening to the
conversations that went on over the wire.</p>

<p>“I’ll not give him a chance this time,” thought
Tom.</p>

<p>A little later he received a call from the central
girl operator. One of the trunk lines did not
work just right, and the girl wanted Tom to test<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
it, before a man was sent out to repair it. The
young lady was a pleasant-voiced one, and, before
he knew it, Tom was exchanging a few jokes with
her.</p>

<p>She suggested how he himself might get the wire
to work better, by making a little adjustment to
the switchboard, and he did so.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” he asked. “Can you hear me any
better?”</p>

<p>“Much better,” she replied. “You ought to go
into the telephone business.”</p>

<p>Then, whether it was something he unconsciously
did to the switchboard, or whether the central
operator made some unusual connection, Tom
never knew. At any rate he found he was “cut
in” on the wire over which Mr. Cutler was talking.</p>

<p>And, as Tom listened for a moment, not meaning
to, he became aware that the man on the other
end of the wire was Barton Sandow. And what
he said was this:</p>

<p>“I’m almost ready to do the trick now. I have
the papers safe.”</p>

<p>Then there came a buzzing on the wire, and
Tom heard no more, but he had listened to enough
to understand that whatever game there was between
Sandow and the junior partner was still
being carried on.</p>

<p>“I want to test that other wire,” came the voice
of the central girl, a moment later, and Tom, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
her request “gave her a ring,” that is, he depressed
the button which flashed a tiny electric light on the
switchboard at which she sat in the distant central
office.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” she announced. “Good-by.”</p>

<p>“I believe I’d like to meet that girl,” thought
Tom. “If it wasn’t against the rules for her to
talk to me, except on business, I’d ask her name.
I’ve almost a good notion to do it anyhow. But
I don’t want to get her into trouble. I must ask
Charley Grove what would happen in case a supervisor
overheard her talking to me just for fun.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his pleasant thoughts by
the necessity of disconnecting Mr. Cutler’s ’phone,
as the drop of a disk indicated that the lawyer
was through talking. Then a door opened and
Mr. Boise and Mr. Kendall came out into the main
office.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ll do jest as you say, of course, Mr.
Boise,” the farmer was saying, in his loud voice.
“If you think it’s best to let my neighbor Simpson
start to tear out that dam, an’ then git an injunction,
I’m willin’ to do it. Only I’d stop him with
a gun, if I had my way.”</p>

<p>“No; if you leave the matter in our hands, you
must do as we say,” insisted Mr. Boise. “But
don’t let it be known that you are going to let
him start to destroy the dam that holds back the
water. In fact don’t mention it anywhere. I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
rather you wouldn’t have spoken of it here, as you
never know who will hear what you will say, and,
if this got out, it might lose you your case.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? I didn’t mean to speak so loud.
But I guess your telephone boy won’t tell, will he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Mr. Boise with a smile.
“We trust Tom, but it’s best to be on the safe
side.”</p>

<p>Tom was grateful for this mark of confidence.
As he turned in his chair, to pick up his bookmark
that had fallen to the floor, he caught sight of Mr.
Cutler’s door. It was partly open and the lawyer
was peering out, looking at the farmer and Mr.
Boise. As he saw Tom’s eyes turned toward him,
the junior partner quickly closed the portal.</p>

<p>“He was listening,” thought Tom. “I’m getting
more and more suspicious of him every day.
Yet, perhaps, I have no right to be.”</p>

<p>But if Tom could have overheard what was
said between the young lawyer and Barton Sandow
that night, when the two met in a certain cafe
near Scollay Square he would have had more cause
than ever for his suspicions.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will work?” Sandow asked,
after the two had conversed at some length.</p>

<p>“It’s bound to. I’ll telephone when Tom is out
at lunch. One of the clerks is left in charge, and
I can easily get rid of him for a few minutes, on
some excuse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>“But can you imitate his voice?”</p>

<p>“Whose? Tom’s? Oh, well enough. Kittridge,
the lawyer who has the other side of the
Kendall case, doesn’t know my voice, and he
doesn’t know Tom in the least. I’ll pretend I’m
the office boy, and that I have a grudge against
the firm, because they won’t raise my wages. All
Kittridge needs is a tip about the dam, and he
can win the case. Kendall will lose it, and then
I’ll casually suggest to Boise that there must have
been a leak somewhere. There’ll be an inquiry,
and Tom will be discharged. Then we can proceed
without having him sneaking in on us, at
every chance he gets.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be easier with him out of the way.
The old doctor has taken quite a notion to him.
But he’s so forgetful everything ought to be easy.”</p>

<p>“Did you bring the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes; here they are. He left them in his study
under a book, but, as there are five hundred books
there he’ll have a task to remember under which
one they were put. He can’t remember, and, before
he can do anything to protect himself, the
property will be disposed of, and you’ll have your
share.”</p>

<p>“Not so loud,” cautioned Elias Cutler, looking
around apprehensively. “Some one might hear
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>“Why, you’re not afraid, are you?”</p>

<p>“No—not exactly, as everything is safe, but be
careful, Barton.”</p>

<p>“If we get rid of Tom Baldwin we’ll have nothing
more to fear, as neither Boise nor Keen suspect
that we have anything to do with each other; do
they?” asked Mr. Sandow.</p>

<p>“Not in the least. If they did—well, I know
I’d be looking for another position.”</p>

<p>The two conversed for some time further, and
then prepared to separate.</p>

<p>“When will you work the trick?” asked Mr.
Sandow.</p>

<p>“As soon as possible. To-morrow, if I get a
chance.”</p>

<p>It was several days after this that, one afternoon,
Mr. Boise came into the office from the
court house, where he had been all day, trying a
case.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” inquired Mr. Keen, of
his partner. “You look annoyed.”</p>

<p>“And I have good cause to be,” replied the
lawyer. “I lost the Kendall case.”</p>

<p>“What! That one where the old farmer was
mixed up in some action over water-rights and a
dam?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I had a good case, and we were
going to apply for an injunction as soon as Simpson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
who is the party Kendall had the dispute with,
started to cut the dam. But, it seems Simpson’s
lawyer, Amos Kittridge, got wind of the affair.
He knew what we were going to do, and he took
action that caused our case to be thrown out of
court. My client, Mr. Kendall lost, and he is
very angry about it.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose Kittridge learned of your
side of the case?” asked Mr. Keen, while Tom
listened anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He’s a trickster, but when he
won he laughed at me, and as much as hinted that
the leak came from this office.”</p>

<p>“From this office?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He advised me to pay my help better,
then they wouldn’t be dissatisfied, and give away
the details of our cases. I tell you, Mr. Keen,
this is a serious matter, and I am going to have
an investigation. I want to see all the clerks in my
office. Some news went out of here that shouldn’t
have gone, and it lost us the case. It was given
over the telephone, Kittridge as much as said.
Tom, I shall have to question you. Do not go
home this afternoon, until I have seen you. Kittridge
is a trickster, and a sneak, but what he did
is legal, though it is not right. But if I find out
who gave him the tip, it will go hard with him!”</p>

<p>Mr. Boise looked sterner than Tom had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
seen him before, and the telephone boy, though
he knew he had had nothing to do with the matter,
felt a little apprehensive.</p>

<p>“If some one used this telephone to talk to Mr.
Kittridge with,” mused Tom, “it may involve me.”</p>

<small>TOM IS ACCUSED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Send</span> the clerks into my office,” said Mr. Boise
to Mr. Keen, as he passed into his own apartment.
“We’ll sift this matter to the bottom.”</p>

<p>One by one the clerks passed into the room of
the senior partner. Low but earnest voices could
be heard from behind the closed door. Several
telephone inquiries came for Mr. Boise, but Tom
had been instructed to turn the clients over to Mr.
Keen, as Mr. Cutler was out.</p>

<p>One by one the clerks came from the room of
Mr. Boise. They looked worried, but not guilty,
and all, evidently, had succeeded in proving to the
satisfaction of their employer that they, at least,
were not guilty of betraying the firm’s secret.</p>

<p>As the last clerk emerged, Mr. Cutler came into
the office. He seemed quite excited over something,
and, as Mr. Boise came from his room at
that moment, the two members of the firm met.</p>

<p>“I hear you lost the Kendall case,” began Mr.
Cutler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>“Yes, I——”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know how it came about,” interrupted
the junior partner, with a vindictive glance
at Tom.</p>

<p>“That is what I have been trying to find out.”</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“You? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that the secret of the injunction about
the dam was betrayed by some one in this office.”</p>

<p>“I fear as much, but I have been unable to discover
who mentioned it, unless one of us three
partners did so,” added Mr. Boise with a smile.</p>

<p>Cutler started. Then he said:</p>

<p>“I fancy if you were to ask the telephone boy
about it he might be able to tell something.”</p>

<p>“The telephone boy? Tom? Do you mean
him?”</p>

<p>“That’s who I mean!” exclaimed Mr. Cutler
sharply.</p>

<p>“I never said a word over the telephone, or in
any other way about this Kendall suit, or any
other!” exclaimed Tom indignantly. “I never talk
about the firm’s business outside!”</p>

<p>“No?” remarked Mr. Cutler sneeringly.
“Then how did it happen that I heard you calling
up Kittridge’s office the other day?”</p>

<p>“Calling up Mr. Kittridge’s office?” repeated
Tom. Then he remembered that Mr. Boise had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
had that lawyer on the wire, refusing a postponement
of the case. He told the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so,” acknowledged Mr. Boise.
“But why do you accuse Tom, Mr. Cutler?” and
he looked sharply at the junior partner.</p>

<p>“Because of something I overheard between Kittridge
and one of his clerks.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“I just came from the court house,” went on
Mr. Cutler. “I heard you had lost your case, and
I saw Kittridge and his clerk laughing over their
success. Then I overheard Kittridge say: ‘We
never would have won the case, but for a tip
Boise’s office boy gave me. He called me up, and
said he had a grudge against the firm because they
wouldn’t raise his wages, and then he let out about
the injunction.’ That’s what Kittridge said.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so!” cried Tom indignantly. “I
never spoke to Mr. Kittridge, over the telephone,
or otherwise, in my life; I merely got his office
once on the wire for Mr. Boise.”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m talking about!” declared
Mr. Cutler. “I say you gave this fact to Kittridge,
and I can prove it. You are responsible for
this leak, and I think you had better discharge him,
Mr. Boise, and get a boy we can trust. He used
to listen to persons talking to me, until I put a stop
to it.”</p>

<p>“I never listened unless it was absolutely necessary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
in order to put some other party on your
wire!” said Tom hotly.</p>

<p>“I think you had better discharge him,” went
on the junior partner. “I know where we can get
a boy we can depend on.”</p>

<p>“This is a serious accusation,” said Mr. Boise
slowly. “Are you—pardon me—are you sure of
your facts, Mr. Cutler?”</p>

<p>“Positive. Why, ask Kittridge.”</p>

<p>“No; I would not like to do that. I would not
want to let him know we have some one here we
can not trust,” but, though he spoke sadly, Mr.
Boise did not look accusingly at Tom. “I have
another plan,” the senior partner went on. “I will
ask the telephone company to make an investigation.
They keep a record of all calls, and they
can tell whether there were more than one call
for the Kittridge office within the last few days.
One I used myself. If there is another on the
record——”</p>

<p>“It means that it was the one when the secret
of the case was given away,” interrupted Mr.
Cutler.</p>

<p>“It does not absolutely prove it, however,” went
on Mr. Boise. “Some one may have called him
up from outside.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but who knew about the plan to let Simpson
partly destroy the dam, so that an injunction
might be secured?” asked Mr. Cutler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>“Well, unfortunately, Mr. Kendall mentioned it
aloud in the office here one day,” admitted Mr.
Boise. “I cautioned him to be careful, but he
spoke before I could prevent him. I don’t know
who heard him. There was no other clients in at
the time.”</p>

<p>“No; but Tom was,” insisted the junior partner.</p>

<p>“Yes; I heard Mr. Kendall’s remarks about the
dam,” admitted the telephone boy. “But I never
spoke to a soul about it. You were also in your
office at the time, Mr. Cutler,” he could not help
adding, “and your door was open.”</p>

<p>“What! You dare accuse me?” cried the
lawyer. “The idea! The impudence. Boise, I
demand his discharge at once!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” spoke the senior partner
calmly, “I do not believe Tom meant to accuse
you of giving our secret away.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” put in Tom.</p>

<p>“He only meant that other persons besides himself
heard what Mr. Kendall so foolishly said.
But I shall investigate this further. I will go to
the telephone company at once. Tom, remain here
until I return.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cutler, with a vindictive glance at the boy,
passed into his private office, and Tom, with a dull,
leaden feeling in his heart, saw Mr. Boise go out.
Our hero waited anxiously for what might happen
next.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A GIRL’S TESTIMONY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Boise had gone Tom sat at the
switchboard, but he had lost all interest, for the
present, in the law book. It was closed, and his
thoughts were all centered on the queer happenings
in which he was involved.</p>

<p>It was getting rather late, and the building was
gradually becoming quiet, as the various tenants
passed out and closed up their offices.</p>

<p>Tom wondered how long he would have to stay,
and whether he had better send some word to his
mother about the delay. Then he decided it would
be best not to. He might have to go home with
bad news soon enough—news that he had been
discharged—though he knew he was innocent, and
he hoped Mr. Boise would be able to prove this.</p>

<p>Presently the door of Mr. Cutler’s room opened,
and that lawyer came out.</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Boise returned yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have all the clerks gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cutler started into Mr. Keen’s room. He
looked in, to discover that his partner was not
there.</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Keen gone home?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Mr. Cutler suddenly,
coming close to Tom, “why don’t you get out of
here.”</p>

<p>“Get out of here? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean before Mr. Boise returns. He’ll probably
find out exactly what you did, and then he’ll
discharge you. If you go now, he’ll not have the
opportunity, and you’ll stand a better chance of
getting another place.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be running away!” exclaimed
Tom indignantly. “That would be like admitting
I was guilty.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” went on Mr. Cutler, in a more
friendly tone than he had ever before used toward
Tom. “I think I know all about how it happened.
You felt a little grieved—perhaps because I have
scolded you once or twice. You wanted to get
even, and, when you heard that conversation about
the dam, you determined to mention it to the
lawyer on the other side. Of course, it was very
wrong, but I don’t believe you’ll do it again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>“I want to help you, even if you did wrong.
Now I’m advising you for your own good. You
can leave now, and I’ll tell Mr. Boise you are
sorry for what you did. He’ll forgive you, I’m
sure. I’ll even help you get another job.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you think me guilty, yet you
would help me get another position like this?”
asked Tom, determined to see how far Cutler
would go.</p>

<p>“Well—er—maybe not a place like this, in a
law office, for they would be sure to ask questions.
But I’d get you a good place. Come, now, you’d
better leave before Mr. Boise gets back with the
proof of your guilt.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he can get proof of my guilt,
when I am not guilty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand all about that,” went on the
lawyer, earnestly, as though he was anxious to
hurry Tom to a decision. “I was young once myself.
You acted hastily. I think I can explain it
to Mr. Boise.”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Tom indignantly. “I’ll not
run away! I never sent that message, and Mr.
Boise will be so informed at the telephone office.
Why, if I went now he would have every reason
to think me guilty!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve done my best for you,” answered
the lawyer, as he turned impatiently aside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
“When you’re discharged, and looking for a place,
don’t blame me. It’s your own fault.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not blame you,” spoke Tom. “I’m not
afraid of the consequences. I trust Mr. Boise.
He’ll not discharge me unjustly. But if he does,
perhaps I can get a place with Dr. Spidderkins,”
he said, as a sudden thought came to him.</p>

<p>“Dr. Spidderkins! What sort of a place can
you get with him? He doesn’t practice any
more?”</p>

<p>The lawyer seemed strangely excited.</p>

<p>“I know that,” replied Tom, “but perhaps he
would be glad to hire me to help look after his
estate. I understand he has quite a large one, and
that his brother-in-law would like to get possession
of it.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? What are you saying?” demanded
Mr. Cutler almost shouting the words, as
he started toward Tom, as though he would strike
him. “Are you making threats—you—you——”</p>

<p>He seemed to be so angry, or so alarmed, that
he could not speak. Before Tom could make
reply, or the lawyer ask any more questions, the
door opened and Mr. Boise entered.</p>

<p>The senior partner of the firm was not alone.
Behind him stood a pretty girl, who glanced
around the office and then frankly smiled at Tom.
He thought she was the prettiest girl he had ever
seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>“Well, I suppose you found out that I was
right about it; did you not?” asked Mr. Cutler.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” replied the senior partner.
“There were two messages sent from this office,
lately, to Mr. Kittridge.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought so,” murmured Mr. Cutler,
while Tom was wondering what the pretty girl
could have to do with the case.</p>

<p>“One message was the one which I sent,” went
on Mr. Boise. “The other was sent the day before
the case came to trial. The manager of the
company looked up his records, and he made a
suggestion which I think will solve the problem.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Mr. Cutler, while he
glanced uneasily at the pretty girl.</p>

<p>“It is this: The manager suggested that the
young lady in charge of that part of the switchboard
in the main office, where our wires are,
might remember something about it. He sent for
her, and I had a talk with her. She does remember
the two calls for the office of Kittridge, for
the reason that, at present his is the only telephone
on a particular circuit.”</p>

<p>“But can she tell who called?” asked Mr.
Cutler.</p>

<p>“Not exactly. I laid the case before her, and
she said she was sure of one thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“That is that the person who is regularly at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
our switchboard did not call for the office of Kittridge
the second time.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense!” exclaimed Mr. Cutler.
“How can she remember a person’s voice?”</p>

<p>“You may ask her yourself,” said Mr. Boise,
as he turned to the pretty girl. “Allow me to introduce
to you Miss Minnie Renfield, who is the
young lady in charge of the trunk lines from our
office. Miss Renfield, just tell Mr. Cutler and
Tom, here, what you told me.”</p>

<p>“I have been a central operator for a number
of years,” said Miss Renfield, with an engaging
smile. “I have a very good memory for voices.
After I hear a voice over the telephone once or
twice, I never forget it. Several of my friends
can do the same thing.</p>

<p>“I know the voice of your private exchange
operator very well. I have had quite some conversation
with him lately, about one of the wires that
was out of order. I know his voice as soon as he
calls for a number.”</p>

<p>Tom smiled. This, then, was the girl whom he
had wished to meet. He had his wish, now, but
he would have been glad had it been under happier
circumstances.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you can recognize
voices over the telephone?” demanded Mr. Cutler.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I can. I remember the two calls for
the Kittridge office. I have to make a note of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
every call, and those two were on a new wire, that
has recently been put in. The first call was made
by your regular operator, I am sure of that.”</p>

<p>“That was the time I had Tom get Kittridge
for me, when I refused to consent to an adjournment,”
put in Mr. Boise.</p>

<p>“But the second call? The call when the secret
was disclosed?” asked Mr. Cutler.</p>

<p>“That was not made by your operator here,”
said Miss Renfield firmly.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” demanded the junior partner.</p>

<p>“Quite sure. I recall wondering at the time
who was calling up. The call came in at one fifty-seven.”</p>

<p>“This is preposterous!” exclaimed Mr. Cutler.
“No one can remember that!”</p>

<p>“I made a record of it,” declared the young
lady. “It was exactly one fifty-seven.”</p>

<p>“And that’s the time I was out to lunch!” exclaimed
Tom suddenly. “I was with my chum,
Charley Grove! He can prove it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Cutler looked confused. But he was not
going to give up yet.</p>

<p>“I think this young lady means all right,” he
said, “but I doubt if she can so readily distinguish
voices over the wire. I believe she is in error. I
think Tom Baldwin sent that message.”</p>

<p>“I believe I can prove that I am right, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
he did not,” answered Minnie Renfield, confidently.
“Will you allow me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Mr. Boise. “This is a
serious matter, and I want it cleared up.”</p>

<p>“Then I am going to propose a little experiment,”
said the girl with a smile at Tom.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>VINDICATION OF TOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two lawyers and the telephone boy looked
curiously at Miss Renfield.</p>

<p>“I am going out to some telephone,” she said.
“I will then call up the office, and each of you,
in turn, may speak to me over the wire. I am sure
I can tell exactly who is talking, though I am not
very familiar with this gentleman’s voice,” and she
looked at Mr. Cutler.</p>

<p>“That is the junior member of our firm,” explained
Mr. Boise. “I think that will be a fair
experiment.”</p>

<p>“I hope it will convince Mr. Cutler that I can
recognize voices over the wire,” went on the central
operator.</p>

<p>“It ought to be easy to do that,” sneered Mr.
Cutler. “You know that only we three are here.”</p>

<p>“You may bring in any other persons you
choose,” said Miss Renfield readily, “and, though
I may not be able to tell who they are, by name,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
I will be able to distinguish their voices from
yours.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” assented Mr. Boise. “We are
ready for the test; eh, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied our hero, grateful to the
girl who had, so opportunely, come to his aid.</p>

<p>Miss Renfield went out, and, in order to make
the experiment more certain, a couple of clerks
from a neighboring office, who happened to be
staying late, were called in. The real reason for
the experiment, however, was not explained to
them.</p>

<p>Presently Miss Renfield called up. As there
were several branch telephones in the law office, at
Mr. Boise’s suggestion himself, his partner, Tom,
and the two clerks each took one, and Tom connected
them all on one central wire.</p>

<p>“Now we are ready,” said Mr. Boise, over the
wire.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are Mr. Boise,” exclaimed the girl.
“I would know your voice anywhere.”</p>

<p>“That was easy enough to do,” spoke Mr. Cutler,
and he talked right into the telephone which
was before him, on his desk. Those engaged in
the experiment were in rooms opening from the
main one, where the switchboard was, and could
see each other.</p>

<p>“That was Mr. Cutler,” came back Miss Renfield’s
tones, calmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>“Ah! She had you that time!” exclaimed Mr.
Boise.</p>

<p>He motioned for one of the clerks to speak, and
the girl at once announced that a stranger was talking.
Then the senior partner nodded to Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s the switchboard boy!” exclaimed the
girl, so that all heard her. “I know his name is
Tom, but I don’t know his last name.”</p>

<p>“Baldwin,” answered our hero, blushing the
least bit. “I am much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>The experiment was tried for some time longer,
but each time Miss Renfield was able to tell
whether one of the strange clerks, or Mr. Boise,
Tom, or Mr. Cutler was speaking.</p>

<p>“I think that is proof enough,” remarked Mr.
Boise to her over the wire. “Come in, please.”</p>

<p>The two clerks left, Mr. Boise thanking them
for their assistance, and Miss Renfield came back
to the office.</p>

<p>“I am fully satisfied,” said the senior partner,
“that this young lady is right.”</p>

<p>“Then you think Tom did not send that message?”
asked Elias Cutler.</p>

<p>“I do not believe he did.”</p>

<p>“Well, who is guilty, then?”</p>

<p>“I can not say. I suppose you would not be
able to tell, if you heard the voice of every one
in my employ, which voice it was that talked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
second time to the law office of Mr. Kittridge?”
he asked the girl.</p>

<p>“Of course, she wouldn’t!” exclaimed Mr. Cutler
hastily. “That would be impossible. If she
could, it would be no evidence.”</p>

<p>He seemed alarmed over something.</p>

<p>“I would not like to make a decision regarding
a voice when such an important matter is involved,”
said the girl gravely. “I am not familiar
with some of the tones of your clerks, as they only
talk over the ’phone occasionally. But I could not
be mistaken in the voice of Tom Baldwin,” she
added, as she smiled once more at the boy whom
she had so completely vindicated.</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” remarked Mr. Boise. “I
never for a moment believed Tom guilty, but I
am glad his innocence is so firmly established. I
am afraid we shall not discover who sent the message,
but I am sure of one thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked his partner quickly.</p>

<p>“That whoever did it is an enemy of this firm—I
may say a traitor, for it was some one in this
office, of that I am positive. If I ever discover
who it was, I shall deal severely with him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cutler turned aside and entered his office
without a word.</p>

<p>“I believe I need detain you no longer, Tom,”
said Mr. Boise. “It is long after your regular
hour. I think we shall have to raise your salary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
again, if we keep you working overtime like this,”
and he smiled at the boy.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind staying,” said Tom genially,
“though of course if you’re going to give me more
money, I’ll not get out an injunction against you,”
and he laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see that you are coming on with your
study of the law,” commented his employer.
“Well, we’ll take the matter under advisement,”
he said, in the manner of a judge finishing up a
case, “and we will let you know later. Good-night.
Good-night, Miss Renfield.”</p>

<p>Tom and the central girl walked out of the office
together.</p>

<p>“I’m ever so much obliged to you,” said Tom,
as they went down in the elevator.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” replied his companion,
whom Tom, stealing a look at now and then,
thought quite the prettiest girl he had ever seen.
It was the second time he had thought the same
thing that day.</p>

<p>“So you are the young lady who told me how
to fix the cord and plug,” went on our hero.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see I’ve been in the central office
for some years now, and I’m getting quite interested
in the work. I have a brother who is an
electrician, and he tells me lots about the instruments,
so I have more advantages than the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
girls. I often fix my switchboard when it gets out
of order.”</p>

<p>“You are quite talented.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it comes natural to me. But, say, I didn’t
want to speak of it to Mr. Boise, but I have a suspicion
who sent that message.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Tom quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t want you to repeat it, but
when that cross man—Mr. Cutler, I believe his
name is—when he was talking this afternoon, his
voice sounded a good deal like the one that sent
the second message to the Kittridge firm. I am not
positive enough of it to tell Mr. Boise so, for I
think Mr. Cutler tried to disguise his voice, but
I’d advise you to keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>“I will,” declared Tom. “I think he has a
grudge against me, because I found out something
about him. I’ll be on the watch, and the next
queer move he makes, I’ll tell Mr. Boise.”</p>

<p>The two young people walked on together for
some distance farther, and Tom was glad to find
that the pretty girl lived quite near him.</p>

<p>“I wish I could meet your brother,” he said.
“Perhaps he would tell me something about telephones,
so I could fix my switchboard if it got out
of order.”</p>

<p>“Come around some evening, and I will introduce
you to him,” promised Miss Renfield, and
Tom earnestly said that he would make the call.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>TOM TELLS HIS SUSPICIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Tom,” began the telephone boy’s
mother that evening, “how are you getting on at
the office? You haven’t told us much about it
lately, but I notice that you stay quite late at times.
They ought to give you more money for that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will, mother. Mr. Boise said
this afternoon that he would think about raising
my wages again, though I now get more than do
other boys in places like mine.”</p>

<p>“How are you coming on with your law work?”
inquired his aunt. “I wish you could soon begin
to practice. Some years ago I invested a little
money I had in some mining stock. I never
realized anything from it, and I believe I was
swindled. I wish you could sue the company. I
can’t afford to hire a lawyer, but if you are going
to be admitted to the bar, perhaps you could take
my case as the first one.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will be a good while before I can
practice law,” remarked Tom with a laugh. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
when I do, Aunt Sallie, I’ll take your case without
a retainer.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you half of whatever you get from
the mining company, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll buy an automobile,” answered our
hero, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He said nothing to the folks at home about what
had happened that afternoon, as he did not want
his mother and aunt to needlessly worry. Yet,
Tom was beginning to feel more and more that he
should tell some one his suspicions regarding Mr.
Cutler and Barton Sandow.</p>

<p>Tom had a chance to speak of his suspicions the
following day. When he was at the switchboard
he heard some one ask for Mr. Cutler, and he
made the connection. He recognized the voice.
It was that of the man who had often spoken before
to the junior partner, and this unseen man,
Tom decided, was Barton Sandow.</p>

<p>The message was a brief one, and, under the
circumstances Tom felt justified in listening to it.</p>

<p>“I will call you up there to-night,” said the person
whom the telephone boy believed was the
rascally brother-in-law of Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“I’ll be here,” replied Mr. Cutler. “Make it
about midnight, and we’ll not be disturbed, and no
fresh central girl will listen to our talk. Get the
rest of the papers to-day, and we’ll wind up the
matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>“So, the game is almost over,” mused Tom, as
he pulled out the plugs, for the two had finished
talking. “I think I had now better tell Mr. Boise
my suspicions.”</p>

<p>He did so after office hours that afternoon,
when the senior partner was alone in his room, and
the clerks had gone home. Tom related the incident
of the first mysterious message he had heard,
how Barton Sandow had tried to make him believe
it was of no importance, and how he had
seen Sandow and the junior partner in consultation
one night at the office.</p>

<p>“And you think they are trying to swindle Dr.
Spidderkins out of his estate?” asked Mr. Boise
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That is my suspicion. And I think that Mr.
Crawford Leeth is also mixed up in it. I saw Sandow
at his office one night.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Tom. It is not a very
nice thing to have to confess, but I have, for some
time, been suspicious of Mr. Cutler. I am sorry
I admitted him to partnership in our firm. He
was a sharp young lawyer, and I thought he would
do good work, but he seems constantly planning
and scheming. I think he knows more about the
leak regarding the Kendall suit than he would be
willing to admit.”</p>

<p>“I believe so, too,” agreed Tom. “What do
you think we had better do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>“You say that Sandow agreed to call him up
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; about midnight. I think Mr. Cutler is
coming here then.”</p>

<p>“Yes; he is. He spoke to me about it, saying he
wanted to prepare some papers in a case he had to
try to-morrow. I thought nothing of that, as he
frequently comes here nights. Perhaps he has
often met Sandow here.”</p>

<p>“I know he did once,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Desperate cases require desperate treatment,”
spoke Mr. Boise musingly. “Tom, I am going to
have you do something, which, if we were dealing
with different people I would not like to ask
of you. But I want to find out whether or not
Mr. Cutler is involved with Sandow in robbing
Dr. Spidderkins. The only way I can do this is
to know what goes on between them to-night. If
you, or I, could hear what is said over the
telephone——”</p>

<p>“I think I can fix that!” exclaimed Tom. “I
can so connect up the switchboard that I can conceal
myself in one of the rooms here, and hear
whatever is said.”</p>

<p>“That will be a good plan. You have my permission
to do so.”</p>

<p>They talked the matter over at some length, and
finally it was arranged that Tom should go home,
get his supper, and then return to the office. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
would station himself in one of the clerk’s rooms,
furthest away from the apartment where the
switchboard was located.</p>

<p>Then, when Sandow called up the suspected
lawyer, the telephone boy could listen to what was
said. He hoped to hear enough to enable him to
expose the two plotters.</p>

<p>“I shall be late again to-night,” said Tom to
his mother when he went home to supper.</p>

<p>“Late again, Tom? Why, what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Well, we have some legal business to attend
to.”</p>

<p>“Has it anything to do with my mining shares?”
inquired his aunt.</p>

<p>“No; but if this goes through, they may make
me a partner in the firm, and then I’ll take your
case.”</p>

<p>All three laughed, for the little family was in
better shape financially than it had been for some
time. Tom’s wages went a long way toward supporting
the two lonely women, and, with what sewing
Mrs. Baldwin and her sister could do, they
had no fears, at least for the present.</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan he and Mr. Boise
had made, Tom concealed himself in the clerk’s
room about ten o’clock. He wanted to be in plenty
of time.</p>

<p>The big office building was deserted, except for
the watchman, and there was no noise, save his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
footsteps as he went from floor to floor, ascertaining
that everything was all right. Gradually it
became more silent down in the street, as the traffic
grew less.</p>

<p>“I hope he comes,” thought Tom, as he sat in
a chair in a dark corner, the branch telephone
ready to his hand.</p>

<p>Midnight struck on a distant church bell. Tom,
who caught himself nodding, sat up with a start.
Surely that was a noise of some one coming along
the corridor. It might be the watchman. No,
it was some one coming into the law offices.</p>

<p>Tom heard a key inserted in a lock. Then some
one entered. There was the click of an electric-light
switch being turned on, and then Tom knew
Mr. Cutler had kept the appointment.</p>

<p>The boy, drawing back farther into the shadow,
heard the lawyer going from room to room. Evidently
he was taking no chances on being discovered.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’ll come in here,” thought Tom.
He got up from the chair, and silently hid behind
a big filing cabinet. And not a moment too soon,
for, the next instant, the door opened and Mr. Cutler
came in, turning on a light as he did so.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE MISSING PAPERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> hardly breathed, fearful lest he might be
discovered. But the lawyer was apparently satisfied
with casually looking into the room, for, in a
moment, he had turned out the light and Tom
heard him going back to the main apartment.</p>

<p>“Now to listen to what they say,” thought the
telephone boy. “I hope Sandow calls him up.”</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken than he heard from
outside, the buzz which told that one of the disk
signals had fallen. Tom had purposely left the
buzzing arrangement on, so that he might know
when the call came in.</p>

<p>“There it is,” he went on. But it did not continue
long for Mr. Cutler shifted the lever controlling
it, and the buzzing ceased. The lawyer
knew how to operate the switchboard.</p>

<p>Tom softly lifted the receiver from the hook of
the instrument at his side. He did it carefully
in order that the click, which always takes place
when this is done, might sound as softly as possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
in the listening ear of Mr. Cutler. Then
Tom heard voices in conversation, and he knew
that the two plotters were making their plans. He
listened intently.</p>

<p>“Is everything ready?” he heard the lawyer ask.</p>

<p>“Everything,” was Sandow’s reply. “I got him
to sign the deeds and mortgages this afternoon.
He didn’t realize what they were. I told him they
were some orders for books he had purchased, and
he is so forgetful that he believed me. He is getting
worse every day.”</p>

<p>“All the better for our purpose then. Well, if
you have all the papers signed, send them to me
at this office to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What will that mean?” asked Sandow, who
knew little about law.</p>

<p>“It will mean that the property will belong to
your wife and you—after I have attached my signature
as witnessing that of Dr. Spidderkins. But
of course, I get my share or——”</p>

<p>“Of course, you will,” Sandow hastened to
assure his fellow-schemer. “I’ll do just as I
promised.”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” announced Cutler grimly, “or
I could have you held for fraudulently obtaining the
deeds and mortgages.”</p>

<p>“What about yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a lawyer knows enough to look out for
himself. But everything will be all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>“I hope that meddlesome boy doesn’t interfere
again,” Tom heard Sandow say. “Did you get
him discharged?”</p>

<p>“No; my plan didn’t work. Boise brought in
a central girl, and she said it wasn’t Tom’s voice
that gave the secret away. I believe the little
witch suspected me. I’ll have to be careful. Now
don’t come here to see me, and don’t call me up.
I think Boise also suspects me, and I’ll have to go
slow. I guess that’s all now. Don’t forget to send
me the papers.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not. I suppose it’s safe to talk over the
’phone this way.”</p>

<p>“Of course. That’s why I selected this time.
There’s no one here, and that central girl is off
duty at night. Well, I guess——”</p>

<p>At that instant Tom’s elbow accidentally touched
the receiver hook, and depressed it sufficiently to
produce a loud click in the instrument.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Barton Sandow, suddenly.
“Is some one listening on this telephone?”</p>

<p>“No; I guess not,” answered the lawyer. “It
was only a click on the wire.”</p>

<p>Tom smiled to himself, as he thought of how
the click had been produced.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to go now,” went on the
lawyer. “I guess we’ve arranged everything.
Don’t forget the papers.”</p>

<p>Then came another click, which told that Sandow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
had hung up his receiver. A little later Tom
heard the office door close behind Cutler.</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” the boy thought, “but I guess I
heard enough. This settles the case. I wish it
was morning, so I could tell Mr. Boise. I wonder
what he’ll do?”</p>

<p>In accordance with the plan, made the night before,
the senior partner of the law firm came to his
office very early the next morning. Tom was there
waiting for him, and none of the clerks, nor the
other two partners, had arrived.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom?” asked Mr. Boise anxiously, and
our hero told all that he had heard.</p>

<p>“Too bad! Too bad!” murmured Mr. Boise.
“Cutler is a bright young man. I am sorry to see
him going wrong. Well, there is no help for it;
I must expose him. You say Sandow is to send
some papers to him this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then we must intercept them. Watch all the
mail that comes for him, and bring it to me. I
will arrange to send him to the court house to look
up some records, so he will be out of the way.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cutler seemed quite surprised when, as he
came in a little later, he was told by Mr. Boise
to go to the surrogate’s office, to see about a certain
will.</p>

<p>“But I have some matters here that require my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
attention,” he objected. “Can’t one of the clerks
go? I——”</p>

<p>“It is a very particular matter,” replied Mr.
Boise somewhat stiffly. “I prefer to have you
do it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the junior partner. “Is
there any mail for me?” he asked of Tom, for
the postman used to lay all the letters on the telephone
table, whence, after Tom had sorted them,
a messenger boy distributed them to the different
offices.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“If any comes have it at once put in my desk,”
went on Mr. Cutler, “and see that it is not disturbed.
I am expecting some important letters.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I guess they are important,” thought
Tom.</p>

<p>With no very good grace Mr. Cutler left the
office to go to the court house. He had not been
gone more than an hour before a special messenger
left a bulky package for him.</p>

<p>“These must be the deeds and mortgages, secured
from Dr. Spidderkins by that rascally Sandow,”
thought Tom, as he left the switchboard for
a moment, to take them to Mr. Boise.</p>

<p>“You had better remain here, Tom,” said the
senior lawyer. “I may want you to go to see Dr.
Spidderkins. Tell Roscoe to take the switchboard
for a while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>Roscoe was the young clerk who relieved Tom
at noon.</p>

<p>“Yes, these are the papers,” went on Mr. Boise,
when Tom had returned to his office. “Ah, to
what depths of depravity Cutler has sunk! He
would commit a serious crime in order to enrich
himself.”</p>

<p>“Is it too late to save the property for Dr. Spidderkins?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No; fortunately you spoke in time. Had it
not been for you the doctor would have lost
nearly all he possessed. His sister-in-law seems to
be in the game also. Her name is on some of the
documents. Now I want you to hurry to the doctor’s
house. You must see him at once, and get
those papers which I sent to him by you, some
time ago. I will need them in arranging this
matter. Do not let Mrs. Sandow know what you
come for.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tom as he started off. “Here
is where I get ahead of Sandow, and get even
with him for calling me a gutter-pup,” he added
to himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sandow answered the door bell, as usual,
when Tom rang. Probably the old doctor, if he
ever heard it, forgot all about it as soon as the
echoes of the peals died away.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” asked the woman,
in a sharp tone, as she saw Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>“I wish to see Dr. Spidderkins.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t. He’s busy.”</p>

<p>“But this is very important.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. You can give me the message,
and I’ll tell him when I get a chance.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but I can’t do that,” said Tom
firmly. “What I have to say is for the doctor
personally.” Then he had an idea. Raising his
voice, so it would penetrate down the long hall
to the doctor’s private library, the boy said: “If
I can’t see Dr. Spidderkins now, I’ll wait here
until I can.”</p>

<p>He fairly shouted the doctor’s name.</p>

<p>“Look here, you young rapscallion,” exclaimed
the woman, “do you think I’m deaf?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” replied Tom, innocently, in
his ordinary tones. “I thought maybe you were.”</p>

<p>But he had accomplished what he desired, for
the doctor, hearing his name called, had roused
himself long enough from poring over his books
to emerge from his room. He came toward the
front door.</p>

<p>“Who called me?” he asked. “I was just reading
an account of the Marathon runner, who
brought the news of that great victory. It is in a
very rare volume, which I found yesterday on—Why,
bless my soul! If it isn’t the boy from the
book store. Let me see, I think I never paid you
that ten dollars. Very forgetful of me, I’m sure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Come right in, and I’ll get it. How is Mr. Townsend?”</p>

<p>“I’m not there any more,” said Tom. “But you
paid the ten dollars all right. Don’t you remember,
I thought I had lost it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you did. That was the night you
brought me the rare volume about—er—um—well,
really I have forgotten what it was about.
But I remember now, you are an electrician.”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” said Tom, with a laugh, “but that’s
pretty near it. I’m a telephone boy, and I have a
message for you.”</p>

<p>“A telephone message?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly; though it’s about a telephone.”</p>

<p>“Come right into my study,” went on the doctor.
“I was just reading a book on—why, bless
my soul, I’ve forgotten what it was about. Oh, my
wretched memory! I must try to be more careful.”</p>

<p>He pulled out an easy chair for Tom, and then
stood in the middle of the room, looking about
him in some bewilderment.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Why—er—I have forgotten what we came
here for.”</p>

<p>“I came here with a message for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. About a book.”</p>

<p>“No; from your lawyer, Mr. Boise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes. You are in a law office. I remember
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>“It’s very important,” went on Tom, in a low
voice, approaching close to the aged physician.
“Perhaps I had better shut the door.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the doctor. “Leave it open. If
it’s closed, she’ll sneak up, and listen at the key
hole. She’s—she’s a—a Tartar!” he exclaimed
softly. “She makes life miserable for me. I don’t
wonder my poor brother died. Come, we’ll go
into an inner room. Then she can’t hear us.”</p>

<p>He opened a door of a smaller apartment, leading
from the main library.</p>

<p>“This is where I keep the rarest books,” said
the doctor. “There is one volume of Horace here
that is worth—well, I really have forgotten for the
moment just how much it is worth, but I know
it is quite valuable. I picked it up the same day
I secured a copy of Plato—but there—what have
you to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Boise wants those papers I brought to you
one day. Those papers about your estate.”</p>

<p>“Papers—did you bring me some papers?”</p>

<p>Tom was beginning to despair of ever getting
the doctor to understand what was wanted.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember?” he asked. “It was the
same day you secured that edition of Smollett,” for
Tom had an excellent memory.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Now I remember, of course. Why
didn’t you say that at first? The papers about my
estate. Why, yes, of course. You brought them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
up the day I secured that rare copy of Smollett.
Of course, I remember now,” and the doctor
chuckled at his excellent memory, which never
could remember anything unless it was associated
with a book.</p>

<p>“Will you get those papers and bring them to
Mr. Boise’s office?” asked Tom. “He wants to
see you at once. It’s very important.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, of course. Right away. The
papers? Of course; let me see now, where did I
put them?”</p>

<p>Tom felt like groaning. It seemed hopeless to
try to get the old physician to remember where
the documents were.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” mused the physician. “Did I put
them in my desk? I’ll look.”</p>

<p>He did without result. Then he explored a
small safe, next a chest of drawers. Then he
looked in all his pockets. Then he stared around
at the rows of books.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” he murmured. “I can’t remember
where I put them.”</p>

<p>Tom thought instead of being queer that it was
the most natural thing in the world for the doctor
not to remember.</p>

<p>“Now where did I put them?” murmured the
old man. “If I had only stuck them in some book,
I’d be sure to remember them.”</p>

<p>At this Tom gave an exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>“What’s the matter?” asked Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“The book!” cried the boy. “Don’t you remember?
You put the papers under a volume of Fielding!”</p>

<p>For, like a flash, it had occurred to the boy
what the doctor had done with the documents, and
Tom recalled the mistake he had made about the
book—thinking it had to do with baseball.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course. Now I remember,” cried
Dr. Spidderkins. “That’s where they are. I knew
I would remember. I’ll get them at once.”</p>

<p>He went to where the book was. He had no
difficulty in recalling where any volume, among
his several thousand, was located on the shelves.</p>

<p>“Here is the book,” he said. “A very rare edition.
Now the papers——” Then a blank look
came over his face. “The papers are gone!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>DR. SPIDDERKINS IS ANGRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> I made a mistake, and that wasn’t
the book,” remarked Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was the book. I am positive about
that. I have a bad memory, but when it comes
to books it is pretty good. Especially when you
speak of it. I am positive I put those papers either
in or under that book.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think, too,” said Tom. “Maybe
they have fallen down.”</p>

<p>He and the doctor made a thorough search.
They took out all the books in that part of the
library, and looked behind them. They even
searched through several volumes on either side
of the Fielding, but no papers were to be found.</p>

<p>“Have you another volume of Mr. Fielding?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I have, yes; but it is only a cheap reprint, and
I never would put valuable papers in or under that.
No, I am sure the papers were here, but they are
gone. What had I better do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>At that moment there came a knock on the door
of the inner room, which the physician had taken
the precaution to lock.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Dr. Spidderkins. “I
thought I heard some one knocking.”</p>

<p>“There was,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated, louder than before,
and a voice which Tom recognized as that of the
mean housekeeper said:</p>

<p>“Come, come! I can’t stand here all day. I’ve got
my work to do. Open the door, now, Dr. Spidderkins.
I know you’re in there, with that boy. Boys
can’t be trusted, that’s been my experience with
’em. You’d better open the door. I’m sure his
feet are muddy and I can’t have my carpets all
tracked up. Come, are you going to open that
door, or not?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t—isn’t that some one speaking?” asked the
aged physician, gently, as if there was the slightest
doubt of it. Mrs. Sandow’s harsh voice could
have been heard through the whole house.</p>

<p>“I—I think it’s the housekeeper,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course; to be sure,” replied the doctor, in a
tone of relief, as if a great uncertainty had been
lifted from his mind. “It must be my housekeeper.
I thought I recognized the voice, but I couldn’t
quite place it. I am afraid—I’m very much afraid—that
my memory is going back on me.”</p>

<p>Tom hadn’t the slightest doubt of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>“Well, are you going to let me in?” demanded
Mrs. Sandow again. “I’d like to know what you
mean, Lemuel, by locking the doors on me. I just
want to know what you’re up to! The idea of
locking doors when I’m around. Come! Are you
going to let me in?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’d better?” inquired the doctor,
of Tom. “She—she’s a Tartar, you know.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better see what she wants,”
suggested the telephone boy.</p>

<p>“That’s an excellent suggestion. I will act upon
it.”</p>

<p>The doctor tiptoed to the door, and, placing his
lips close against a panel, whispered as loudly as
he could:</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“What do I want?” repeated Mrs. Sandow. “I
want to come in, that’s what I want. I have something
to say to you. It’s important. Let me in at
once.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait a moment,” went on the
physician.</p>

<p>“Wait? What for, I should like to know?
Haven’t I been waiting here, and knocking until
I’ve almost worn the skin off my knuckles? Why
should I wait any longer?”</p>

<p>But the doctor did not reply. Instead he tiptoed
over to where Tom stood, a curious spectator and
listener to what was going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>“Shall I—shall I let her in?” asked the aged
physician of the boy.</p>

<p>Tom could not help smiling. This seemed a
matter for the doctor alone to settle. Yet he asked
advice upon it.</p>

<p>“I suppose you had better,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I had better,” repeated Dr.
Spidderkins. “She’d get in, anyhow,” he added.
“Oh, but she <i>is</i> a woman. There’s no use talking,
she certainly is a Tartar. I—I don’t know when I
ever met, or heard of, or read of, in all ancient
history, for example, one to equal her. Lady Macbeth,
perhaps. You recall Lady Macbeth, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let me in, Dr. Spidderkins, or
shall I have to go and get my duplicate keys, and
open the door myself?” interrupted the harsh voice
of the housekeeper.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” whispered the doctor.
“Duplicate keys! I knew she must have some way
of getting into this room. Once I found a copy of
Dante, which I prized very highly, laid upside
down on my table, and I’m almost certain that I
left it right side up. But then my wretched
memory——”</p>

<p>A rattling of the knob reminded him that the
housekeeper was still waiting.</p>

<p>“Then you really think I’d better let her in?”
again whispered the doctor to Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>The telephone boy nodded.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will, but say nothing to her about
what you told me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>The doctor unlocked the door. Mrs. Sandow,
who had, just as the doctor suspected she would,
made her way to the library, was seen standing in a
belligerent attitude in that apartment.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s taken you long enough to open the
door,” she snapped.</p>

<p>“Yes, we—we were very busy,” said Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what that good-for-nothing
boy is doing here all the while?” went on the angry
woman.</p>

<p>As no one offered to enlighten her she glared at
Tom.</p>

<p>“Did—er—did you want to speak to me?”
asked the physician, and Tom waited anxiously for
the answer. He thought it might have something
to do with the matter in hand.</p>

<p>“Of course I want to speak to you,” said Mrs.
Sandow. “Do you think I’d come all the way here
from my kitchen, and waste my time knocking at
locked doors, though for the life of me I can’t see
why you should lock you door, for I’m sure I don’t
want to take any of your old books, no matter what
others may wish, but then of course——” Here
Mrs. Sandow appeared to forget what she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
started out to say, but she switched off on another
tack and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember me telling you that the water
pipes in the kitchen would need fixing?”</p>

<p>“I—er—I seem to remember——” began the
doctor.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t remember, and that’s just the
trouble. You don’t remember anything. You’d
forget to eat if I didn’t call you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now I remember!” cried the doctor. “It
was about the furnace. You said we’d need a new
grate. I knew I would remember that, because I
associated it in my mind with a book about Alexander
the Great, and——”</p>

<p>“No, no! Nothing of the sort,” interrupted
Mrs. Sandow. “That was last year when the
grate broke, and you had to get a new one. This
is about the water pipes in the kitchen. What I
came to tell you was that one had burst, the water
is spouting all over the room, and we need a
plumber right away!”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! Why didn’t you say so at
once?” asked the doctor, in some alarm.</p>

<p>“I would have, only you had your door locked,
and an honest person can’t make her way about,”
and the housekeeper looked very much hurt.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a plumber at once,” said the doctor. “I
know where there is one, on this street, or is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the next street?—I can’t seem to remember
now——”</p>

<p>“And the water is squirting all over the
kitchen,” went on Mrs. Sandow. “It ought to be
shut off, only I don’t know where to shut it off.
That’s another secret about this house,” she added
significantly.</p>

<p>“I think I can find out the place to shut it off,”
said Tom. “Very likely it’s down in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“Humph! It’s a good thing you know something,”
said Mrs. Sandow, with a sniff.</p>

<p>In a few moments the telephone boy had shut
off the water, and the plumber had been summoned.
That mechanic promised to come at once,
and repair the leak.</p>

<p>“If you had attended to the pipe when I told
you to,” went on Mrs. Sandow, when the excitement
had somewhat calmed down, “this never
would have happened.”</p>

<p>“I meant to,” said the doctor, “but I forgot——”</p>

<p>“You’re always forgetting,” interrupted his sister-in-law.
“Some day you’ll forget to come home,
or lose yourself and then——”</p>

<p>“I’ve lost something now,” exclaimed the doctor.
“We were just hunting for something when
you knocked, Mrs. Sandow. Have you seen——”</p>

<p>Tom was attacked with a sudden fit of coughing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
He wanted to attract the doctor’s attention, and
warn him not to speak of the papers.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” exclaimed the physician, when
he saw what a spasm Tom was having. “That’s a
terrible cough. You must take something for it.
I would write you a prescription, only I have such
a wretched memory that I might start to give you
something for a cough, and end up by writing out
directions how to cure the mumps. You haven’t
the mumps, have you?”</p>

<p>“I had them once, and that was enough,” said
Tom. “But, doctor, perhaps I had better call another
time.”</p>

<p>Tom thought that if he went away, and came
back, he would have a chance to speak to the physician
alone, and warn him.</p>

<p>But the doctor did not seem to understand. He
knew he had been looking for something, and that
he had not found it. He appealed to the housekeeper,
and Tom began to fear that all his plans
would miscarry.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. Sandow, likely thinking that
with such a poor memory to depend on she could
obtain no information from the doctor, or else
recollecting that her kitchen was covered with
water from the burst pipe, hurried from the room.
Tom saw his chance, and took it.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to speak of the papers before
her,” he said. “She might——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>“Oh, yes, it was papers we were looking for,”
interrupted the doctor. “I remember now. We
couldn’t find them. But they must be here somewhere.
I’ll look in some other valuable books.”</p>

<p>But the papers were not to be found. Search as
the two did, in all likely and unlikely places, the
missing documents were not disclosed.</p>

<p>“I guess we can’t find them,” spoke Tom.</p>

<p>“It does look that way,” admitted the doctor.
“I wonder what we had better do next?”</p>

<p>The aged physician seemed quite helpless in the
face of this emergency.</p>

<p>“You had better come with me to see Mr.
Boise,” suggested Tom. “He can tell you what
to do. I may say to you, Dr. Spidderkins, that
your estate is in danger.”</p>

<p>“In danger? From whom?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that Mr. Boise would want me
to tell you, but I will risk saying that he suspects
Mr. and Mrs. Sandow.”</p>

<p>“What? Those two whom I have trusted in
everything?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Boise suspects them, and also suspects a
young lawyer in his office.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed the doctor. “I know
nothing about business. All I know about is books.
Do you suppose they have got everything I possess?
I used to be a rich man.”</p>

<p>He was quite distressed, but Tom hastened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
assure him that he thought the plot had been discovered
in time.</p>

<p>“I left everything to Mr. and Mrs. Sandow,”
went on the physician. “I gave them money
whenever they wanted it, and I signed the checks
they made out for the tradesmen’s bills. Now to
think how they have repaid me!”</p>

<p>“We had better hurry down to the office,”
urged Tom. “I think Mr. Boise will be waiting
for you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will go at once. Let me see,
where did I put that book I was reading? Oh,
here it is. I think I will take it along with me.
It may calm my mind.”</p>

<p>He started from the library, Tom following.
The doctor got to the door, and was going out,
when the telephone boy called his attention to the
fact that he had neither hat nor coat on, and there
was a cold March wind blowing.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! I forgot all about a hat,” admitted
the aged physician. “I am getting quite
forgetful. I was wondering where I could get a
copy of the first edition of Carlyle’s Sartor Resartus.
I have only a common edition, and I want
a rare one. Thank you,” he added, as Tom
handed him his hat and coat from the rack.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Lemuel?” asked Mrs.
Sandow, as she suddenly appeared in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>“I—I am going out,” answered the doctor
mildly.</p>

<p>“Going out? This cold day! You forgot you
were to sign some checks for the grocer and
butcher.”</p>

<p>“I thought I made out those checks.”</p>

<p>“No; they were for the milkman and the coal
dealer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I must make them out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will do when we get back,” suggested
Tom, for he had an idea the woman was
only carrying out the general plan of herself and
her husband, to cheat Dr. Spidderkins out of as
much money as possible by getting him to sign
extra checks.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it, young man?”
asked Mrs. Sandow sharply.</p>

<p>“The doctor is in a hurry to get to his lawyer’s
office, and I thought the checks might wait until
he returned.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to a lawyer’s office?” asked
Mrs. Sandow, with suspicion in her tone.</p>

<p>“I—I believe so—or was it the book store?”
replied Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“The lawyer’s first, and then, if you like, to
the book store,” answered Tom with a smile at
the old man’s eccentricities.</p>

<p>“You had better stay in,” suggested Mrs. Sandow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
in more gentle tones. “It is very cold out,
and perhaps I can go for you.”</p>

<p>Dr. Spidderkins hesitated. It was easy for Tom
to see that the woman exercised considerable control
over the aged physician. But the telephone
boy was determined to frustrate her schemes.</p>

<p>“We had better hurry,” said Tom, taking hold
of the old man’s arm. “Mr. Boise will be waiting
for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, we must hurry,” assented the doctor.
“I’ll be back soon, Mrs. Sandow, and perhaps,”
he added significantly, “you will not be so
glad to see me.”</p>

<p>“Not glad to see you? Why, I am always glad
to see you, Lemuel,” said the woman, with a
whine. “I am very fond of you. I was only
anxious for your own good, when I spoke.”</p>

<p>“And for your own, and your husband’s,”
thought Tom.</p>

<p>The woman saw it would be useless to protest
further. Tom and his aged friend left,
boarded a car, and were riding toward the law
office.</p>

<p>Once there Mr. Boise soon explained to the doctor
the plots of Mr. and Mrs. Sandow. The documents,
which had come in the mail to Mr. Cutler,
proved to be deeds and mortgages which the physician
had, unknowingly, signed the night before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
They transferred the control of most of his property
to his rascally relatives.</p>

<p>“Is it too late to prevent the loss of my estate?”
asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“Well, I am afraid you will lose some of it,”
replied the lawyer. “They have been deceiving
you for a long time, and, very likely, they have a
good share of your money now. You have been
so wrapped up in your books, that you did not
know about it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we prevent them from getting away with
it?” asked Dr. Spidderkins, as he seemed to rouse
to sudden anger at the thought of the manner in
which he had been swindled.</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps, if we act promptly.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s act promptly!” exclaimed the physician.
“We’ll go back to my house and we’ll
clean the rascals out, bag and baggage! I’m an
old man, but when I get roused up I’m as good as
a young one!”</p>

<p>To look at him one would not doubt this, for
the doctor seemed to have grown several years
younger. He had been carrying a book but now
he thrust it into his pocket as if it was of no value.
He was thoroughly in earnest.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said, to Tom and Mr. Boise.
“We’ll go and see if we can’t end their plots!
I’ll have something to say to Mr. and Mrs. Sandow
that they won’t like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>“That’s the way to talk!” exclaimed Mr. Boise
admiringly. “You’ve been too much engrossed in
your books heretofore, Dr. Spidderkins.”</p>

<p>“I guess I have. I need some honest persons
to look after me. Well, maybe I’ll get them, after
this affair is over.”</p>

<p>Accompanied by Tom and Mr. Boise the doctor
went back home, to “clear the rascals out,”
as he expressed it several times, on the ride to the
Back Bay district.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>THE FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Suppose</span> we should be too late,” suggested the
doctor, as they neared the house.</p>

<p>“I think we will be in time,” replied Mr. Boise.
“Of course Mrs. Sandow may become suspicious
over what happened while Tom was there, and she
may inform her husband. But they can do little
now.”</p>

<p>“Can we get back what they have already
taken?” inquired the physician. “I am not overly
fond of money, in fact all I use it for is to buy
books, but I do not like to be robbed and cheated,
especially by those whom I have befriended.
When my brother died I told his widow she could
live with me as my housekeeper. Then, when she
got married again, I still allowed her and her husband
to live in my house. And this is the way
they have repaid me!”</p>

<p>“I fancy we will be able to make them give up
their ill-gotten spoils,” remarked the lawyer.
“But we must first catch them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>“You say one of your partners was mixed in
with Sandow in the game?” asked Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am sorry to say Mr. Cutler seems to
be involved. Without his aid Barton Sandow
could not have done what he has. But I shall deal
with him, and also with a man named Leeth, who
aided him and Sandow.”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering if perhaps that Cutler
might not suspect something, and give the Sandows
warning,” suggested the doctor.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” admitted Mr. Boise.
“He may do so. Still, it is too late now. We will
go to your house. I want to have a talk with Mrs.
Sandow.”</p>

<p>“And I’d like to meet that rascally husband of
hers,” added the doctor grimly. “I’ll have something
to say to him.”</p>

<p>“I fancy Mrs. Sandow is as guilty as her husband,”
went on Mr. Boise. “She knew of your
wealth, and probably suggested to him that they
try to secure control of it. Well, they very nearly
succeeded. But we are getting near your home,
are we not, Dr. Spidderkins?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we’ll get out at the next corner.”</p>

<p>They alighted and turned up the long walk to
the house.</p>

<p>“Now, if you haven’t forgotten your key, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
can get in without ringing the bell,” said the
lawyer.</p>

<p>Dr. Spidderkins began to search through his
various pockets.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed. “There’s that letter I
forgot to mail. It’s about some choice books, too.
Bless my soul, but I am getting forgetful. Let’s
see, what was it I was looking for?”</p>

<p>“Your key,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Well, this must be it. For a wonder
I didn’t forget to bring it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can surprise Mrs. Sandow,” suggested
the lawyer. “Don’t make any more noise
than you can help.”</p>

<p>Softly the door was opened, and then on tiptoes
they entered the hall. The house seemed strangely
quiet.</p>

<p>“She’ll probably be in the sitting-room,” suggested
the physician, but the woman was not there.
Nor was she in any of the downstairs apartments.</p>

<p>“Look in her bedroom,” proposed the lawyer.</p>

<p>The three ascended the stairs. No voice called
to know who was coming up. The house remained
quiet.</p>

<p>“I guess she’s gone,” said Mr. Boise.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” admitted Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>A glance into Mrs. Sandow’s room showed that
she had taken flight. The apartment was in confusion.
Clothing was scattered about, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
she had hastily packed what she could, and gone
off.</p>

<p>“This is too bad!” exclaimed Mr. Boise. “I
depended on making her confess, before she saw
her husband. She has probably joined him.”</p>

<p>“And taken a lot of my money with her,” added
the physician. “I only hope they did not disturb
my valuable books. I must look and see.”</p>

<p>A hasty search convinced him that his precious
volumes were undisturbed in the library.</p>

<p>“I wonder where she has gone to?” mused the
lawyer. “I would like to find her.”</p>

<p>Tom, who was in the front hall, uttered an exclamation
as he picked up a scrap of yellow paper.</p>

<p>“Here’s part of a telegram,” he said.</p>

<p>“So it is. Perhaps Sandow telegraphed for her
to meet him. Can you make out any words on it,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“There are parts of some words, and two complete
ones. It reads: ‘—eet me at Park—’ and
then comes a tear.”</p>

<p>“See if we can’t find the other pieces,” suggested
the doctor. “She probably tore it up, and scattered
them about.”</p>

<p>But a close search failed to reveal anything
more. The remainder of the telegram appeared
to be destroyed.</p>

<p>“Let’s use a little detective ability, and see if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
we can’t guess what the entire telegram was,” suggested
Mr. Boise.</p>

<p>“This is about the middle part of a telegraph
blank,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“I can tell from the printing on the back. I
once worked as a messenger boy for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“That’s one point,” remarked Mr. Boise. “If
this is the middle part of the message, there must
have been several words before these, and some
after them. Probably the first part told Mrs. Sandow
that everything was discovered. Then came
this sentence ‘Meet me at Park—’; but what park
is there around here?”</p>

<p>“None where they would be likely to meet,” replied
Tom, who knew that part of Boston pretty
well by this time. “I have it!” he exclaimed. “It
isn’t a park. It’s Parker House. I saw Sandow
there one night!”</p>

<p>“That’s it! Why didn’t I think of that!” exclaimed
Mr. Boise. “Tom, you’ll be a better
lawyer than I am, if you keep on.”</p>

<p>“Come on then!” said Dr. Spidderkins. “We
must go to the Parker House and arrest them!
They shan’t get away with my money if I can
help it!”</p>

<p>“We’d better hurry,” suggested Tom. “The
Parker House is quite a ride from here.”</p>

<p>“I have a better plan than that,” remarked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
lawyer. “I’ll telephone to my office, and have Mr.
Keen get a policeman and go to the Parker House.
He can get there before we will, and he can cause
the arrest of the couple.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the doctor. “There’s a telephone
in my house here, but I always forget to
use it, and whenever I want anything I generally
walk after it. Now it will come in handy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Boise was soon in communication with Mr.
Keen, and told him how to proceed.</p>

<p>“Arrest them at once,” said the elderly lawyer.
“What’s that? Cutler came back, took some
papers from his desk, and hurried away again?
Well, say nothing about that until I return.</p>

<p>“I think we have seen the last of Mr. Cutler,”
remarked Mr. Boise as he hung up the receiver.
“Well, perhaps it is better so. I should have gotten
rid of him in any event.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has some papers belonging to me,”
said Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“No. Before we came away I went through his
desk, and I took out all the documents referring
to your estate. But I hope Keen is in time.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see,” suggested the physician, and,
locking up his house, he, together with Mr. Boise
and Tom, hurried to the Parker House.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>TOM’S PROMOTION—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> had a trolley car seemed to travel so
slowly as did that one from the Back Bay section,
in which the three anxious ones rode. But finally
they reached their destination. As they hurried
into the lobby of the hotel they were met by Mr.
Keen.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Mr. Boise anxiously.</p>

<p>“We caught them just in time,” replied his partner.
“They had engaged a cab, and had tickets
to New York, when I appeared on the scene with
an officer, and placed them under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?”</p>

<p>“Safe in a room, with a policeman on guard.
I thought that better than taking them to the station
house, as I believe they will confess, and make
restitution. They are both badly frightened.”</p>

<p>This proved to be the case. All the bluster had
gone from Mr. Sandow, and his wife was no
longer the sneering woman she had been. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
weeping in one corner of the room as Dr. Spidderkins
and his friends entered.</p>

<p>“So, this is the way you repay me for my kindness
to you both, is it?” the aged physician exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lemuel, forgive me!” pleaded his sister-in-law.
“I don’t know why we did it! But you
had so much money and we didn’t have any.”</p>

<p>“I would always have provided you with a comfortable
home,” went on the doctor. “But now
I will compel you to give up what you stole, and
I will turn you out of my house.”</p>

<p>“We’ll—we’ll give it all back, Lemuel,”
promised Mrs. Sandow. “We didn’t spend much
of it. That lawyer got some, but the rest we
have.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Eli Cutler is as guilty as we are,” added
Mr. Sandow. “Why don’t you arrest him?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we will,” replied Mr. Boise. “But
are you now ready to turn over to Dr. Spidderkins
all that you took belonging to him?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” mumbled Sandow.</p>

<p>“If they do I think it would be better to avoid
the notoriety of an arrest and prosecution,” suggested
the lawyer to his client.</p>

<p>Dr. Spidderkins nodded, and thus the matter
was arranged. Sandow turned over to the lawyer
certain valuable papers, bonds and mortgages
which he had managed to secure from the doctor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
chiefly through that old gentleman’s forgetfulness
about business details. The scheming couple had
also secured considerable cash, by the simple process
of making the doctor make out checks twice
for the same bill. The second checks they kept
for themselves.</p>

<p>“There will be no prosecution, in case you leave
Boston and never return,” said Mr. Boise, when
the details had been completed, and most of Dr.
Spidderkins’ stolen fortune had been restored to
him. “Do you agree to that?”</p>

<p>“We have to, I suppose,” remarked Sandow.</p>

<p>He and his wife left the Parker House, taking
their baggage with them. The police officer
escorted them to the depot—to see that they took
the train.</p>

<p>“Now that this disagreeable business is over,
I think I can return to my home and my books,”
remarked Dr. Spidderkins. “I suppose you will
deal with Mr. Cutler?”</p>

<p>“I do not think there will be a chance,” replied
Mr. Boise. “I fancy he is far enough away from
here by this time.”</p>

<p>After events proved that he was, for he sailed
for England with his ill-gotten gains, which, however,
were much smaller than they would have
been, had not Tom heard that mysterious message
going over the wire, and acted as he did. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Leeth also disappeared, but he had secured only a
small sum.</p>

<p>“I can not tell you how much I am indebted to
you, for what you have done for me, Mr. Boise,”
went on the doctor. “If it had not been for you
I would be a poor man to-day, and I could never
buy any more choice books.”</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me; thank Tom. He is the hero
on this occasion,” replied the lawyer, looking at
the telephone boy. “He engineered all this, and,
by revealing to me the duplicity of my partner,
enabled me to act in time to save your wealth.
Had it not been for Tom we never could have
succeeded.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed the doctor heartily. “I had
nearly forgotten that. Oh, what shall I do about
my treacherous memory? But I’ll not forget you,
Tom. I am a little tired over this excitement, but
I will call on you this evening, and properly express
my appreciation. Where do you live?”</p>

<p>Tom gave him the address, the physician writing
it down on the fly-leaf of a book, as the best place
for such an important memorandum.</p>

<p>“You need not report back to the office, Tom,”
said his employer. “I fancy you have done enough
for one day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied our hero, as he left the
hotel and went home.</p>

<p>It seemed that Mrs. Baldwin, and Tom’s Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Sallie would never finish asking questions about
what had happened, when Tom told them the
occurrences of the day.</p>

<p>“And to think that you did the most part,” exclaimed
his aunt.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it just happened so,” replied Tom,
who was nothing if not modest. “I guess the telephone
did the most part. That’s a wonderful
invention.”</p>

<p>They were talking in the small sitting-room
after supper that evening, when there came a knock
on the door.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Tom, and when he opened the
portal there stood Dr. Spidderkins.</p>

<p>“Does Tom Baldwin——” he began, when he
saw the boy who had been of such service to him.
“Why, of course, there you are,” he finished. “I
guess I must have knocked at half a dozen houses.
You see I wrote your address down in a book, and
then I forgot what book I had written it in. But
I called up Mr. Boise and, fortunately, he remembered
it. I have come to thank you for what you
did for me.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” invited Tom, and he ushered the
guest into the modest sitting-room.</p>

<p>“This is my mother, Dr. Spidderkins,” he said,
“and my aunt, Miss Ramsey.”</p>

<p>“Ramsey—Ramsey——” repeated the physician.
“Why, I used to know a Ramsey family.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Let me see, there was a Jeanette Ramsey—and a
Sallie Ramsey—and—why, bless my soul—you’re
Jeanette Ramsey, aren’t you?” and he looked at
Tom’s mother.</p>

<p>“That was my name before I was married. But
is this the Dr. Spidderkins that used to live in
Lowell?”</p>

<p>“The very same. Bless my soul! I suppose
I’ve grown so old you wouldn’t know me, but I’d
remember you anywhere,” said the doctor gallantly,
with a bow to the ladies. “Bless my soul!
To think of meeting you again, after all these
years. Tom, you young rascal, why didn’t you
tell me your mother was Jeanette Ramsey, with
whom I used to play when I was a boy, though
I was ever so much older than she was?”</p>

<p>“You never asked me,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>The doctor spent a pleasant evening with his
former friends, talking over old times.</p>

<p>“I heard Tom speak of a Dr. Spidderkins,” said
Mrs. Baldwin, “but I did not know it was the
one I used to know.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, this is a strange world,” mused
the old gentleman. “But I am nearly forgetting
what I came for, in the excitement of meeting you
two ladies again. Tom, I want to show my appreciation
of what you did for me. I understand
from Mr. Boise that you want to study law.
There is no better profession in the world. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
I am going to send you to college and then to a
law school. I expect you to graduate with honors,
and then you can look after my legal business for
me, for I am getting to have such a bad memory
that I need a guardian. Will you go, Tom?”</p>

<p>Tom was silent a moment. The offer was so
unexpected that it nearly took his breath away. He
had never dreamed of such advancement.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Dr. Spidderkins, inquiringly, “I
hope you don’t prefer being a telephone boy to
becoming a lawyer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. If I could study law I think I would
like it better than anything else.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall study law,” went on the doctor
firmly. “It’s the least I can do for you, after
you saved my fortune for me. After you graduate
I shall see that you do not lack for practice.</p>

<p>“There is another matter. Now that the Sandows
are gone I shall be all alone in that big house.
That would never do. I need some one to look
after me, or I would forget to eat. Won’t you
come and take charge of the place, Mrs. Baldwin?
I would pay you and Miss Ramsey well, and it
would be a good home for Tom.”</p>

<p>It did not need much urging to have the two
women give up their sewing work, which had paid
very poorly of late, and accept the doctor’s offer.
Within a week they were established in the Spidderkins
mansion, and Tom had been entered at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
college, where he was to make a specialty of law.</p>

<p>One evening, not long after this, Tom was called
to the telephone, in the doctor’s house. He heard
a girl’s voice speaking.</p>

<p>“Is this Tom Baldwin?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Who is this?”</p>

<p>“I thought you were coming over to see my
brother, and learn something about a telephone
switchboard,” came back over the wire, followed
by a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, so I am. Why, it’s—it’s Minnie Renfield!”
exclaimed Tom, as he recognized the voice
of the central girl, who had done him such a good
turn.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” she replied. “When are you
coming over?”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to learn about a switchboard any
more,” replied Tom. “I’m going to study law.
But I’m coming to see—your brother, just the
same.”</p>

<p>Minnie laughed.</p>

<p>Tom went at the difficult study of law as he had
done at learning how to operate a switchboard,
and he did well. Soon after our hero left the
law office, Charley Grove took his place, as the
brokerage firm he was with failed, and Charley
made a most efficient telephone operator.</p>

<p>As for Tom, when he graduated, and had to
spend some time in a law office, before he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
be admitted to the bar, he naturally selected the
firm of Boise &amp; Keen, for Mr. Cutler’s name was
dropped after his flight.</p>

<p>To-day the firm is Boise, Keen &amp; Baldwin, for
Tom, in a few years, was made the junior member.
He no longer lives in Dr. Spidderkins’ house,
though his mother and aunt continue to reside
there, for Tom is married, but I don’t believe you
can guess who the young lady was. What’s that?
Minnie Renfield, the telephone girl? Why, how
ever in the world did you guess it, boys?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TO THE READER</h2>
</div>

<p>Now that you have finished reading this story,
we desire to call your attention to all the other
volumes in this remarkable series for boys.</p>

<p>We feel that we have made a distinct find in
Mr. Frank V. Webster, who is under contract to
write exclusively for the Cupples &amp; Leon Company.
Mr. Webster’s style is very much like that
of the late-lamented Mr. Alger, but his tales are
all thoroughly up-to-date. This author, though
still young, has been a great traveler, and therefore
he knows exactly what he is writing about, be
it a story of city or country life, a tale of the far
west, or of the frozen north.</p>

<p>“How can you write such fine stories?” a boy
once asked Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it comes natural,” answered the
author. “I have been through so much and seen
so much, it seems as if I could go on telling stories
forever.”</p>

<p>On the following pages we give the outlines of
some of Mr. Webster’s stories. Read them—they
will interest you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE BOY FROM THE RANCH</h3>

<p>Did you ever stop to think how strange life in a
big city must appear to a boy who has never been
anywhere but on the boundless plains?</p>

<p>“I simply had to write that story—I couldn’t
help it,” said Mr. Webster, in telling us how “The
Boy from the Ranch; or, Roy Bradner’s City
Experiences,” came to be penned. “Some years
ago I was on a ranch, and there I met a lad just
like Roy, who told me of all the things that had
happened to him when he went to Chicago for his
uncle on business.”</p>

<p>In this story of life on the plains and in New
York, Roy is a clever lad who knows how to take
his own part, no matter what happens. His father
being sick, he is sent to the great metropolis to
transact some business. Everything is new and
strange to him and he makes some queer mistakes
which make very funny reading. He falls into the
hands of a sharper who has been cheating Mr.
Bradner out of the income of some valuable property.
The sharper and his tools try to get the
ranch boy out of the way. But—well, Roy turns
the tables, and makes things mighty warm for the
fellows.</p>

<p>A splendid volume, bound in cloth, and well
illustrated. Published by the Cupples &amp; Leon
Company, at thirty-five cents. Sent postpaid if you
can not get it from your bookseller.</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG TREASURE HUNTER</h3>

<p>Do you like stories of the frozen north? of great
hardships amid ice and snow? and of thrilling encounters
with wild beasts and with thieving
Indians? If you do you will not want to miss
Frank V. Webster’s book entitled: “The Young
Treasure Hunter; or, Fred Stanley’s Trip to
Alaska.”</p>

<p>“The most interesting story of the Alaskan gold
fields I ever read,” one boy has written to us. “My
father was one of the first men to go to Alaska, and
he says the pictures of life there are true. I guess
Mr. Webster must have been there himself.”</p>

<p>This story tells of how a poor boy joined a party
in search of a golden treasure, and of how, after
the treasure was discovered, a bad man, aided
by some Alaskan Indians, tried to get the wealth
away. Fred proved himself a hero on more than
one occasion, and we know all boys will like him
for that. On one occasion the youth brings down
a fine moose, and on another he and his chum suffer
from snow blindness and become lost in the dazzling
whiteness.</p>

<p>This book might easily have been issued at one
dollar or one dollar and a half, but Mr. Webster
insisted that the price be made the same as on all
his other volumes, namely, thirty-five cents. Issued
by the Cupples &amp; Leon Company, New York, and
for sale by booksellers everywhere.</p>

<h3>BOB THE CASTAWAY</h3>

<p>One day Mr. Webster came into our office and
placed a manuscript on the desk of our editor.</p>

<p>“Did you ever take a sea voyage when you were
a boy?” he asked as he dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>The editor said he had never had that pleasure.</p>

<p>“Well, I did—and I was wrecked, too,” went
on the author. “And I was sent to sea for the
same reason that Bob Henderson had to go.”</p>

<p>Then we got very curious and read the story,
which had for its title: “Bob the Castaway; or,
The Wreck of the Eagle.” We had to laugh
when we read that yarn. Bob was such a fun-loving
fellow, and he played such awful jokes. He
tried to play a joke on an old sea captain at a church
donation party, but, to the boy’s horror, the minister
got the benefit (?) of the fun. Then Bob’s parents
sent him to sea to cure him, and the boy was
wrecked on an island in the Pacific, and had many
thrilling adventures. It’s a true-to-life story, for
it contains many pages out of Mr. Webster’s own
experiences. A very nervous passenger on the
ship makes a lot of unconscious fun. There is a
great hurricane, and an encounter with South Sea
natives.</p>

<p>A fine volume, bound in cloth, and well illustrated,
and the price is thirty-five cents. Buy it
from your bookseller, or send to the Cupples &amp;
Leon Company, New York, for it.</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG FIREMEN OF LAKEVILLE</h3>

<p>“Fire! fire! fire!”</p>

<p>That is the cry that sometimes thrills us, ringing
out during the day or in the silent hours of
the night. And who is it whose heart does not
jump within him when he sees the devouring flames
leaping skyward, and sees the engines, hose-carts
and long hook-and-ladder trucks dashing through
the streets to put out the conflagration?</p>

<p>The life of the fireman is one full of excitement
and often of peril. This Mr. Frank V. Webster
fully realized when he wrote, “The Young Firemen
of Lakeville; or, Herbert Dare’s Pluck.”
How the boys became dissatisfied with the old
“bucket brigade” and organized a real fire company,
and how they worked at more than one fire,
is told with great fidelity to life. And then there
is the secret of the old mansion, and that is worked
up in Mr. Webster’s best style.</p>

<p>“The mystery in this story is taken from life,”
Mr. Webster wrote us. “It surrounded an old man
and a fortune worth nearly half a million dollars.
A good-for-nothing grandson wanted to get it away
from him.”</p>

<p>Published, as are all the Frank V. Webster
books, by the Cupples &amp; Leon Company, New
York. Bound in cloth, illustrated, and for sale
everywhere at thirty-five cents.</p>

<h3>THE NEWSBOY PARTNERS</h3>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>That was the question that Jimmy Small, a New
York newsboy, asked when first he met Dick, in
a dark alleyway, where Jimmy had gone to sleep
because he didn’t have the price of a bed at the
lodging-house.</p>

<p>Dick was a well-dressed boy, and lay there with
a nasty cut on the head. He couldn’t tell how he
had got into the alleyway or where he had come
from. All he could remember was his first name—and
as he was found in a box, Jimmy called him
Dick Box.</p>

<p>The poor newsboy befriended Dick, and the two
became partners. Dick could not remember his
past, but he remembered how to read and write,
and he taught Jimmy, and the two worked their
way upward. Then one day something happened—something
truly wonderful—and Dick—well, he
didn’t remain poor, unknown Dick Box for a great
while longer.</p>

<p>This story, issued under the title of “The Newsboy
Partners; or, Who Was Dick Box?” is a
fascinating tale, told in Mr. Webster’s best style.
Splendidly illustrated, bound in cloth, price thirty-five
cents. Published by the Cupples &amp; Leon Co.,
New York. Ask your bookseller to show you this
volume.</p>
